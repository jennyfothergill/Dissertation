abstract = {The anion binding tendencies of the two fluorogenic ureas L1H and L2H, containing the 2-anthracenyl and 1-pyrenyl moieties as signaling units, respectively, have been investigated in MeCN and DMSO by absorption, emission, and 1H NMR spectroscopies. The formation of stable 1:1 receptor:anion H-bond complexes has been confirmed by structural studies on the crystalline [Bu4N][L 1{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}Cl] and [Bu4N][L 2H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}CH3COO] salts. Complexation induces significant variations of the emission properties of L1H and L2H according to a multifaceted behavior, which depends upon the fluorogenic substituent, the solvent, and the basicity of the anion. Poorly basic anions (Cl-, Br-) cause a red shift of the emission band(s). Carboxylates (CH3COO-, C6H 5COO-) induce fluorescence quenching due to the occurrence of an electron-transfer process taking place in the locally excited complex [L-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}X]-. However, this excited complex may undergo an intracomplex proton transfer from one urea N-H fragment to the anion, to give the tautomeric excited complex [L{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H-X] -*, which emits at higher wavelength. F- displays a unique behavior: It forms with L1H a stable [L- H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}F]- complex which in the excited state undergoes intracomplex proton transfer, to give the poorly emissive excited tautomer [L{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H-F]-*. With L2H, on moderate addition of F-, the 1:1 H-bond complex forms, and the blue fluorescence of pyrene is quenched. Large excess addition of F- promotes deprotonation of the ground-state complex, according to the equilibrium [L2H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}F]- + F- {\^{a}}‡† [L2]- + HF2-. The deprotonated receptor [L2]- is distinctly emissive (yellow fluorescence), which generates the fluorimetric response ON1-OFF-ON2 of receptor L2H with respect to F-. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  {\&}  Co. KGaA, Weinheim. In this contribution, for the first time, the molecular n-doping of a donor-acceptor (D-A) copolymer achieving 200-fold enhancement of electrical conductivity by rationally tailoring the side chains without changing its D-A backbone is successfully improved. Instead of the traditional alkyl side chains for poly([N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl](NDI)-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)) (N2200), polar triethylene glycol type side chains is utilized and a high electrical conductivity of 0.17 S cm -1 after doping with (4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine is achieved, which is the highest reported value for n-type D-A copolymers. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the polar side chains can significantly reduce the clustering of dopant molecules and favor the dispersion of the dopant in the host matrix as compared to the traditional alkyl side chains. Accordingly, intimate contact between the host and dopant molecules in the NDI-based copolymer with polar side chains facilitates molecular doping with increased doping efficiency and electrical conductivity. For the first time, a heterogeneous thermoelectric transport model for such a material is proposed, that is the percolation of charge carriers from conducting ordered regions through poorly conductive disordered regions, which provides pointers for further increase in the themoelectric properties of n-type D-A copolymers.},

abstract = {Abstract— Chlorophyll a in aqueous hexane solutions has two fluorescence peaks, two fluorescence excitation peaks in the blue, and two fluorescence excitation peaks in the red. One of these set of peaks (excitation 2.34$\mu$‐1 and 1.52$\mu$‐1, fluorescence 1–50$\mu$‐1) is identical with those found in methanol solutions of chlorophyll a and is assigned to an unaggregated species, while the other set of peaks (excitation 2.44$\mu$‐1 and 1.475$\mu$‐l, fluorescence 1.48$\mu$‐l) is assigned to a species aggregated in the presence of water. The spectral shifts occurring in the aggregate follow the selection rules obtained by McRae and Kasha for a linear stack of parallel dye molecules. The sharply increased overlap of absorption and fluorescence leads to resonance fluorescence in the aggregate. The resonance fluorescence is demonstrated experimentally.

abstract = {A key component to enhancing reproducibility in the molecular simulation community is reducing ambiguity in the parameterization of molecular models. Ambiguity in molecular models often stems from the dissemination of molecular force fields in a format that is not directly usable or is ambiguously documented via a non-machine readable mechanism. Specifically, the lack of a general tool for performing automated atom-typing under the rules of a particular force field facilitates errors in model parameterization that may go unnoticed if other researchers are unable reproduce this process. Here, we present Foyer, a Python tool that enables users to define force field atom-typing rules in a format that is both machine- and human-readable thus eliminating ambiguity in atom-typing and additionally providing a framework for force field dissemination. Foyer defines force fields in an XML format, where SMARTS strings are used to define the chemical context of a particular atom type. Herein we describe the underlying methodology of the Foyer package, highlighting its advantages over typical atom-typing approaches and demonstrate is application in several use-cases.},

abstract = {The emission spectrum of CdSe platelets has been observed at 2 K under laser excitation from 0.1 to 10 MW/cm2. By light pulses from a frequency‐doubled Nd:YAG laser (531 nm) hot electrons are created in CdSe, which thermalize into the exciton bands within 10−13 s and decay radiatively within 10−9 s. The spectra, obtained by this excitation, show a considerable increase of the temperature of the crystals. By resonant excitation, i.e. direct excitation of the valence band electrons into the exciton bands by a tunable laser, this temperature increase could be avoided. A Bose condensation of the excitons, as expected by Gross et al., was not observed. Instead, results have been obtained which seem to indicate the formation of exciton molecules and the condensation of the excitons into drops with an electron‐hole pair density of about 2 × 1017 cm−3.

abstract = {The application of liquid-exfoliated 2D transition metal disulfides (TMDs) as the hole transport layers (HTLs) in nonfullerene-based organic solar cells is reported. It is shown that solution processing of few-layer WS2 or MoS2 suspensions directly onto transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes changes their work function without the need for any further treatment. HTLs comprising WS2 are found to exhibit higher uniformity on ITO than those of MoS2 and consistently yield solar cells with superior power conversion efficiency (PCE), improved fill factor (FF), enhanced short-circuit current (JSC), and lower series resistance than devices based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) and MoS2. Cells based on the ternary bulk-heterojunction PBDB-T-2F:Y6:PC71BM with WS2 as the HTL exhibit the highest PCE of 17{\%}, with an FF of 78{\%}, open-circuit voltage of 0.84 V, and a JSC of 26 mA cm−2. Analysis of the cells' optical and carrier recombination characteristics indicates that the enhanced performance is most likely attributed to a combination of favorable photonic structure and reduced bimolecular recombination losses in WS2-based cells. The achieved PCE is the highest reported to date for organic solar cells comprised of 2D charge transport interlayers and highlights the potential of TMDs as inexpensive HTLs for high-efficiency organic photovoltaics.},

abstract = {Hydrogen bonding with fluoride is a key interaction encountered when analyzing the mode of action of 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxyadenosine synthase, the only known enzyme capable of catalyzing the formation of a C-F bond from F-. Further understanding of the effect of hydrogen bonding on the structure and reactivity of complexed fluoride is therefore important for catalysis and numerous other applications, such as anion supramolecular chemistry. Herein we disclose a detailed study examining the structure of 18 novel urea-fluoride complexes in the solid state, by X-ray and neutron diffraction, and in solution phase and explore the reactivity of these complexes as a fluoride source in SN2 chemistry. Experimental data show that the structure, coordination strength, and reactivity of the urea-fluoride complexes are tunable by modifying substituents on the urea receptor. Hammett analysis of aryl groups on the urea indicates that fluoride binding is dependent on $\sigma$p and $\sigma$m parameters with stronger binding being observed for electron-deficient urea ligands. For the first time, defined urea-fluoride complexes are used as fluoride-binding reagents for the nucleophilic substitution of a model alkyl bromide. The reaction is slower in comparison with known alcohol-fluoride complexes, but SN2 is largely favored over E2, at a ratio surpassing all hydrogen-bonded complexes documented in the literature for the model alkyl bromide employed. Increased second-order rate constants at higher dilution support the hypothesis that the reactive species is a 1:1 urea-fluoride complex of type [UF]- (U = urea) resulting from partial dissociation of the parent compound [U2F]-. The dissociation processes can be quantified through a combination of UV and NMR assays, including DOSY and HOESY analyses that illuminate the complexation state and H-bonding in solution.},

abstract = {Here we report an orientation-dependent statistical all-atom potential derived from side-chain packing, named OPUS-PSP. It features a basis set of 19 rigid-body blocks extracted from the chemical structures of all 20 amino acid residues. The potential is generated from the orientation-specific packing statistics of pairs of those blocks in a non-redundant structural database. The purpose of such an approach is to capture the essential elements of orientation dependence in molecular packing interactions. Tests of OPUS-PSP on commonly used decoy sets demonstrate that it significantly outperforms most of the existing knowledge-based potentials in terms of both its ability to recognize native structures and consistency in achieving high Z-scores across decoy sets. As OPUS-PSP excludes interactions among main-chain atoms, its success highlights the crucial importance of side-chain packing in forming native protein structures. Moreover, OPUS-PSP does not explicitly include solvation terms, and thus the potential should perform well when the solvation effect is difficult to determine, such as in membrane proteins. Overall, OPUS-PSP is a generally applicable potential for protein structure modeling, especially for handling side-chain conformations, one of the most difficult steps in high-accuracy protein structure prediction and refinement. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, the F- ion first establishes a hydrogen-bonding interaction with 1 to give the most stable 1:1 complex, and then on addition of a second equivalent, induces urea deprotonation, due to the formation of HF2-. The orange-red deprotonated urea solution uptakes carbon dioxide from air to give the tetrabutylammonium salt of the hydrogencarbonate H-bond complex, [Bu4N][1.HCO3], whose crystal and molecular structures have been determined.},

abstract = {The importance of anion receptors is a reflection of the ubiquitousness of anions, their functions in biological and industrial processes, as well as their behaviour as pollutants. In the immense field of anion receptor chemistry which has expanded greatly in the past few decades, one of the most prominent binding sites is (thio)urea. The simple synthesis of diverse (thio)urea derivatives, their possibility to form two H-bonds with anions and a promising selectivity with anions of complementary geometry are factors that gave rise to a plethora of studies reporting new organic molecules with different properties and applicability. This review includes the most important examples of (thio)urea receptors from the very beginning, until present. Many authors have used (thio)urea moieties in the computer-aided design of anion sensors, which was then followed by their synthesis, and utilization in the photophysical characterization of host-guest systems, and studies in the transport of ions and ion pairs through membranes. These endeavours led to their successful utilization in the fields of crystal engineering and development of functional materials. Characterization of supramolecular systems and investigations of the complexation thermodynamics has been conducted by use of different analytical and physico-chemical methods. Consequently, it is highly beneficial to summarize all aspects of anion recognition by (thio)ureas within one review article. This critical review containing 386 references classifies (thio)urea derivatives, published from 1990 to 2015, with respect to the complexity of the receptors and the number of urea groups in the molecule.},

It has been reported that the charge transport properties depend on molecular structure and molecular packing. In the solid state, $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking of small molecules is significant in the charge transport process. Since $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking of conjugated small molecules is influenced at different degrees by other intra- and intermolecular interactions, as a result, $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking and further the charge transport properties can be controlled or tuned by crystal engineering through precise chemical modification. In this perspective, we give some typical examples illustrating the strategy of controlling $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking in single crystals. Furthermore, we attempt to clarify the complex relationship between $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking and other types of molecular interactions, and its influence on charge transport properties.},

All coarse-grained force fields are ranked according to their ability of preserving the experimentally known crystalline molecular arrangement of P3HT. The coarse-grained force fields parametrized in the amorphous melt turned out to accurately reproduce the structural quantities of the melt, as well as to preserve the lamellar ordering of the P3HT oligomers in $\pi$-stacks. However, the exact crystal structure is not reproduced. The combination of Boltzmann inversion for bonded and iterative Boltzmann inversion with pressure correction for nonbonded degrees of freedom gives the best coarse-grained model.},

abstract = {The optimal design of DNA origami systems that assemble rapidly and robustly is hampered by the lack of a model for self-assembly that is sufficiently detailed yet computationally tractable. Here, we propose a model for DNA origami that strikes a balance between these two criteria by representing these systems on a lattice at the level of binding domains. The free energy of hybridization between individual binding domains is estimated with a nearest-neighbour model. Double helical segments are treated as rigid rods, but we allow flexibility at points where the backbone of one of the strands is interrupted, which provides a reasonably realistic representation of partially and fully assembled states. Particular attention is paid to the constraints imposed by the double helical twist, as they determine where strand crossovers between adjacent helices can occur. To improve the efficiency of sampling configuration space, we develop Monte Carlo methods for sampling scaffold conformations in near-assembled states, and we carry out simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, enabling us to avoid considering states with unbound staples. We demonstrate that our model can quickly sample assembled configurations of a small origami design previously studied with the oxDNA model, as well as a design with staples that span longer segments of the scaffold. The sampling ability of our method should allow for good statistics to be obtained when studying the assembly pathways, and is suited to investigating in particular the effects of design and assembly conditions on these pathways and their resulting final assembled structures.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Helical peptides are known as efficient mediators of electron transfer; however, their use is limited to compounds longer that 7-10 residues. To overcome this limitation, $\alpha$-helicomimetic foldamers, based on the oligourea backbone with the general formula [-CH(R)-CH2-NH-CO-NH]n, were synthesized. Oligoureas are known to adopt a robust 2.5-helical conformation where only four residues are enough to form stable 1.5 helical turns. This feature makes them great models to study the charge transfer process and the dependence of the mechanism of the electron transition on the length of the mediator. Two families of different chain length (2, 4 and 6 residues) oligoureas were synthesized with a thiol group attached to the $\delta$+ or $\delta$- helix dipole pole. This enables the adsorption of the molecules onto the gold surface, leading to the formation of self-assembled monolayers. The helicity of compounds was confirmed in solution and in the solid state. Such systems were used to study the electron transfer process by current sensing atomic force microscopy (CS-AFM). The results showed that oligoureas may act as electron transfer mediators. Additionally, it was shown by the increasing force applied to the AFM tip that the oligourea helix is more stable than the helix formed by peptides.},

Ambiguity in molecular models often stems from the dissemination of molecular force fields in a format that is not directly usable or is ambiguously documented via a non-machine readable mechanism. Specifically, the lack of a general tool for performing automated atom-typing under the rules of a particular force field facilitates errors in model parameterization that may go unnoticed if other researchers are unable reproduce this process. Here, we present Foyer, a Python tool that enables users to define force field atom-typing rules in a format that is both machine- and human-readable thus eliminating ambiguity in atom-typing and additionally providing a framework for force field dissemination. Foyer defines force fields in an XML format, where SMARTS strings are used to define the chemical context of a particular atom type. Herein we describe the underlying methodology of the Foyer package, highlighting its advantages over typical atom-typing approaches and demonstrate is application in several use-cases.},

They now find utility as hydrogen-bond donors in organocatalysts and anion transporters, as important scaffolds in supramolecular chemistry, as lithiation directors, amination substrates, and promoters of metalation, and as substrates for novel rearrangement reactions. Highlighted herein is the remarkably rapid and recent development of the chemistry of ureas, which for many years had been considered unreactive, intractable, and of little value.

The zero-field hole mobility is shown to increase as the annealing temperature or average molecular weights of samples are increased, in accordance with experimental results. Crystal structure analysis shows that the annealing temperature dependence of the mobility can be attributed to the size and structural order of the crystallites in both the chain-backbone and $\pi$-stacking directions. However, the molecular weight dependence of the mobility cannot be rationalized in the same way. Longer chains are shown to belong to more crystallites in the morphology, suggesting that the crystals become better connected as the molecular weight of the sample increases.

abstract = {Over billions of years, evolutionary pressure has facilitated the development of sophisticated and diverse light-harvesting systems in photosynthetic organisms, enabling them to adapt to a variety of habitats and light conditions. Today, driven by the need for cheap and efficient solar power, we turn to photosynthetic organisms and their light-active supramolecular assemblies for bio-inspiration. By studying natural systems, we can learn more about the basic principles behind the fine-tuned functionalities of light capture and energy transfer on the molecular level. In this review, we use ideas from evolutionary ecology and quantum mechanics to elucidate the parameters that underpin the efficient and robust light-harvesting machinery of natural light-harvesting systems. The family of antenna proteins of cryptophyte algae serves as an example to illustrate the evolutionary diversification process on a structural and consequently a photophysical level. Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy experiments reveal the existence of coherence among vibronic levels in the initial response of light-harvesting proteins to femtosecond optical excitation. We discuss what implications quantum transport processes might have for light harvesting. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Since the entanglement length Ne is found to be approximately 35, our chains cover the crossover from the nonentangled to the entangled regime. The Rouse model provides an excellent description for short chains N {\textless} Ne, while the dynamics of the long chains can be described by the reptation model. By mapping the model chains onto chemical species we give estimates of the times and distances of onset of the slowing down in motion due to reptation. Comparison to neutron spin-echo data confirm our mapping procedure, resolving a discrepancy between various experiments. By considering the primitive chain we are able to directly visualize the confinement to a tube. Analyzing the Rouse mode relaxation allows us to exclude the generalized Rouse models, while the original reptation prediction gives a good description of the data. {\textcopyright} 1990 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Reactive force field (ReaxFF), a recent and novel bond order potential, allows for reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulations for modeling larger and more complex molecular systems involving chemical reactions when compared with computation intensive quantum mechanical methods. However, ReaxFF MD can be approximately 10-50 times slower than classical MD due to its explicit modeling of bond forming and breaking, the dynamic charge equilibration at each time-step, and its one order smaller time-step than the classical MD, all of which pose significant computational challenges in simulation capability to reach spatio-temporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds. The very recent advances of graphics processing unit (GPU) provide not only highly favorable performance for GPU enabled MD programs compared with CPU implementations but also an opportunity to manage with the computing power and memory demanding nature imposed on computer hardware by ReaxFF MD. In this paper, we present the algorithms of GMD-Reax, the first GPU enabled ReaxFF MD program with significantly improved performance surpassing CPU implementations on desktop workstations. The performance of GMD-Reax has been benchmarked on a PC equipped with a NVIDIA C2050 GPU for coal pyrolysis simulation systems with atoms ranging from 1378 to 27,283. GMD-Reax achieved speedups as high as 12 times faster than Duin et al.'s FORTRAN codes in Lammps on 8 CPU cores and 6 times faster than the Lammps' C codes based on PuReMD in terms of the simulation time per time-step averaged over 100 steps. GMD-Reax could be used as a new and efficient computational tool for exploiting very complex molecular reactions via ReaxFF MD simulation on desktop workstations.},

abstract = {To assess the relative electronic influence of highly substituted aryl isocyanides on transition metal centers, a series of C4v-symmetric Cr(CNR)(CO)5 complexes featuring various alkyl, aryl, and m-terphenyl substituents have been prepared. A correlation between carbonyl-ligand 13C{\{}1H{\}} NMR chemical shift ($\delta$CO) and calculated Cotton-Kraihanzel (C-K) force constant (kCO) is presented for these complexes to determine the relative changes in isocyanide $\sigma$-donor/$\pi$-acid ratio as a function of substituent identity and pattern. For nonfluorinated aryl isocyanides possessing alkyl or aryl substitution, minimal variation in effective $\sigma$-donor/$\pi$-acid ratio is observed over the series. In addition, aryl isocyanides featuring strongly electron-releasing substituents display an electronic influence that nearly matches that of nonfluorinated alkyl isocyanides. Lower $\sigma$-donor/$\pi$-acid ratios are displayed by polyfluorinated aryl isocyanide ligands. However, the degree of this attenuation relative to nonfluorinated aryl isocyanides is not substantial and significantly higher $\sigma$-donor/$\pi$-acid ratios than CO are observed in all cases. Substituent patterns for polyfluorinated aryl isocyanides are identified that give rise to low relative $\sigma$-donor/$\pi$-acid ratios but offer synthetic convenience for coordination chemistry applications. In order to expand the range of available substitution patterns for comparison, the syntheses of the new m-terphenyl isocyanides CNArTripp2, CNp-MeArMes2, CNp-MeArDArF2, and CNp-FArDArF2 are also reported (ArTripp2 = 2,6-(2,4,6-(i-Pr)3C6H2)2C6H3); p-MeArMes2 = 2,6-(2,4,6-Me3C6H2)2-4-Me-C6H2); p-MeArDArF2 = 2,6-(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)2-4-Me-C6H2); p-FArDArF2 = 2,6-(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)2-4-F-C6H2).},

abstract = {Solar fuel production often starts with the energy from light being absorbed by an assembly of molecules; this electronic excitation is subsequently transferred to a suitable acceptor. For example, in photosynthesis, antenna complexes capture sunlight and direct the energy to reaction centres that then carry out the associated chemistry. In this Review, we describe the principles learned from studies of various natural antenna complexes and suggest how to elucidate strategies for designing light-harvesting systems. We envisage that such systems will be used for solar fuel production, to direct and regulate excitation energy flow using molecular organizations that facilitate feedback and control, or to transfer excitons over long distances. Also described are the notable properties of light-harvesting chromophores, spatial-energetic landscapes, the roles of excitonic states and quantum coherence, as well as how antennas are regulated and photoprotected. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract = {Bis(arylisocyanide) complexes of tungsten containing bulky bidentate aryl phosphine ligands adopt either cis or trans conformations, depending on the nature of the para-substituent group on the aryl isocyanide ligand. Ab initio calculations on a series of ligands, p-RC6H4NC, indicate that the energy of the LUMO is determined by the electron-withdrawing/donating capabilities of the substituent group, which determine the relative $\pi$-acidity of the ligand. Strong $\pi$ acids, which contain electron-withdrawing groups, tend to polarize sufficient charge density away from the metal center to effect the formation of the sterically less favorable, but electronically stabilized, cis conformer. Weaker $\pi$ acids, containing donor substituents, do not provide enough electronic stabilization to overcome steric repulsion, resulting in the adoption of trans geometry. (CNC6H4NC)W(dppe)2 exists as the cis conformer, as does (CNC6H2(CH3)2NC)W(dppe)2, while (CNC6(CH3)4NC)W(dppe)2, with increased steric bulk coupled with decreased $\pi$-acidity, exists as the trans conformer. Theoretical and experimental studies indicate that the energy match between isocyanide ligands and the metal center can be modified significantly by the selection of various substituents and that relatively subtle variations in the electronic structure of the ligands can have dramatic effects on the structures of the resulting complexes.},

Morphologies with monodisperse chains were generated previously using an optimized molecular dynamics force-field and represent a spectrum of nanostructured order. We discover that a combined consideration of backbone clustering and system-wide disorder arising from side-chain conformations are correlated with hole mobility. Furthermore, we show that strongly interconnected thiophene backbones are required for efficient charge transport. This definitively shows the role “tie-chains” play in enabling mobile charges in P3HT. By marrying QCC and KMC over multiple length- and time-scales, we demonstrate that it is now possible to routinely probe the relationship between molecular nanostructure and device performance.},

The resulting binuclear organometallic complexes were observed to pack into ladder-like anisotropic arrays in the solid state. Crystallographic and computational evidence suggests that this packing motif can be attributed to a combination of intermolecular II-$\pi$and urea-$\pi$interactions. Similar to other N,N′-diarylureas bearing electron-withdrawing groups, 1,3-bis(p-isocyanophenyl)urea and the organometallic complexes prepared therefrom also exhibit an affinity toward anion binding in nonaqueous solution.

abstract = {In spite of the excellent ligation properties of isocyanides, until a few years ago there was only a small number of known multidentate ligands of this type. One of the reasons for this lack of interest, when compared to monodentate isocyanides, was the linear arrangement of the MCNR group, which usually inhibits the formation of mononuclear chelate complexes and leads to the formation of multinuclear or polymeric metal complexes. In these, the multidentate ligand acts in a monodentate fashion towards each metal atom. Only recently has a series of polyisocyanides with large ligand backbones been synthesized successfully. Bidentate isocyanides can bridge two metal atoms or react to give chelates with only one metal center. Tripodal ligands form mono‐ or binuclear complexes, in which the largest organometallic rings observed to date occur (up to 36 atoms). This class of ligands promises to be interesting for the synthesis of stable, diagnostically important technetium complexes of the type [Tc(CNR)6]+. There also appear to be applications for tripodal isocyanides in catalysis. A facial, chiral Cr(CNR*)3 unit might be able to catalyze the hydrogenation or isomerization of prochiral double bonds. It is even possible to bind triisocyanides with suitable backbones to carbonyl trimetal clusters, thereby stabilizing them, or making selective cluster formation possible. Coordinated isocyanides can be transformed readily into carbene ligands, which, in the future, could lead to complexes with polycarbene ligation.

Cyanine dyes are such a class of molecules where the spatial proximity of several dyes leads to overlapping electron orbitals and thus to the creation of a new energy landscape compared to that of the individual units. In this work, we create artificial H-aggregates of exactly two Cyanine 3 (Cy3) dyes by covalently linking them to a DNA molecule with controlled subnanometer distances. The absorption spectra of these coupled systems exhibit a blue-shifted peak, whose intensity varies depending on the distance between the dyes and the rigidity of the DNA template. Simulated vibrational resolved spectra, based on molecular orbital theory, excellently reproduce the experimentally observed features. Circular dichroism spectroscopy additionally reveals distinct signals, which indicates a chiral arrangement of the dye molecules. Molecular dynamic simulations of a Cy3−Cy3 construct including a 14-base pair DNA sequence verified chiral stacking of the dye molecules.},

abstract = {A complete set of intermolecular potential functions has been developed for use in computer simulations of proteins in their native environment. Parameters are reported for 25 peptide residues as well as the common neutral and charged terminal groups. The potential functions have the simple Coulomb plus Lennard-Jones form and are compatible with the widely used models for water, TIP4P, TIP3P, and SPC. The parameters were obtained and tested primarily in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations of 36 pure organic liquids and numerous aqueous solutions of organic ions representative of subunits in the side chains and backbones of proteins. Bond stretch, angle bend, and torsional terms have been adopted from the AMBER united-atom force field. As reported here, further testing has involved studies of conformational energy surfaces and optimizations of the crystal structures for four cyclic hexapeptides and a cyclic pentapeptide. The average root-mean-square deviation from the X-ray structures of the crystals is only 0.17 A for the atomic positions and 3$\backslash$$\backslash$ for the unit cell volumes. A more critical test was then provided by performing energy minimizations for the complete crystal of the protein crambin, including 182 water molecules that were initially placed via a Monte Carlo simulation. The resultant root-mean-square deviation for the non-hydrogen atoms is still ca. 0.2 A and the variation in the errors for charged, polar, and nonpolar residues is small. Improvement is apparent over the AMBER united-atom force field which has previously been demonstrated to be superior to many alternatives.},

abstract = {A Martini coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) model for the doped conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is developed. It is shown that the diffusion coefficients decrease exponentially as the hydration level is reduced. A Martini coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) model for the doped conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is developed. The morphology of PEDOT:Tos ( i.e. PEDOT doped with molecular tosylate) and its crystallization in aqueous solution for different oxidation levels were calculated using the developed method and compared with corresponding all atomistic MD simulations. The diffusion coefficients of Na + and Cl − ions in PEDOT:Tos are studied using the developed coarse-grained MD approach. It is shown that the diffusion coefficients decrease exponentially as the hydration level is reduced. It is also predicted that the diffusion coefficients decrease when the doping level of PEDOT is increased. The observed behavior is related to the evolution of water clusters and trapping of ions around the polymer matrix as the hydration level changes. The predicted behavior of the ionic diffusion coefficients can be tested experimentally, and we believe that molecular picture of ionic diffusion in PEDOT unraveled in the present study is instrumental for the design of polymeric materials and devices for better and enhanced performance. },

abstract = {The exciton transfer in a molecular dimer embedded in a condensed medium is investigated theoretically. In order to include coherent vibrational dynamics a single effective mode per monomer is split off from the whole set of vibrational degrees of freedom of the dimer and the environment. The remaining modes are treated as a heat bath. To study the dissipative exciton transfer dynamics the density matrix formalism is applied. Choosing an appropriate exciton-vibrational basis set with respect to the two effective modes the theory is formulated in the related state representation. The general approach is applied to the exciton motion in a chlorophyll a/b dimer of the light-harvesting complex of the photosystem II of higher plants. The complex dynamic behavior following an ultrafast optical excitation in the absorption region of the chlorophyll b monomer is studied in detail.},

Monohydride 1 serves as a well-defined isocyano analogue of the tetracarbonyl hydride HCo(CO)4. While tetrakis-phosphine analogues of HCo(CO)4 have been reported previously, these compounds have failed to exhibit a reactivity profile that can be compared and contrasted with HCo(CO)4 in a systematic fashion. Herein, HCo(CNArMes2)4 (1) is shown to be a readily accessed and reactive complex that allows for this comparison. For example, HCo(CNArMes2)4 (1) is found to decompose smoothly to the $\kappa$1-C-iminoformyl complex Co($\eta$6-(Mes)-$\kappa$1C-C(H)NArMes2)(CNArMes2) (2). Kinetic analysis of this decomposition and that of the d1-isotopomer DCo(CNArMes2)4 (1-d1) revealed a unimolecular process characterized by a large primary kH/kD isotope effect (3.2(6)) and no dependence on the presence of free CNArMes2. These data point to rate-limiting hydride $\alpha$-migration and formation of the $\kappa$1-C-iminoformyl species [Co($\kappa$1-C-C(H)=NArMes2)(CNArMes2)3] as a critical intermediate. Indeed, ligand substitution reactions of HCo(CNArMes2)4 (1), as well as 13C-labeling experiments of the decomposition product 2, demonstrate that hydride $\alpha$-migration is the dominant mechanistic feature of this system. Most notably, this behavior is in contrast with that of HCo(CO)4, for which it has been established that CO ligand dissociation is the initial mechanistic feature. Additional support for the critical role of hydride $\alpha$-migration in HCo(CNArMes2)4 (1) was obtained by the development of catalytic CNArMes2 1,1-hydrogenation to form a stable and isolable methylenimine.},

abstract = {Understanding the properties of electronically interacting molecular chromophores, which involve internally coupled electronic-vibrational motions, is important to the spectroscopy of many biologically relevant systems. Here we apply linear absorption, circular dichroism, and two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy to study the polarized collective excitations of excitonically coupled cyanine dimers (Cy3)2 that are rigidly positioned within the opposing sugar-phosphate backbones of the double-stranded region of a double-stranded (ds)-single-stranded (ss) DNA fork construct. We show that the exciton-coupling strength of the (Cy3)2-DNA construct can be systematically varied with temperature below the ds-ss DNA denaturation transition. We interpret spectroscopic measurements in terms of the Holstein vibronic dimer model, from which we obtain information about the local conformation of the (Cy3)2 dimer, as well as the degree of static disorder experienced by the Cy3 monomer and the (Cy3)2 dimer probe locally within their respective DNA duplex environments. The properties of the (Cy3)2-DNA construct we determine suggest that it may be employed as a useful model system to test fundamental concepts of protein-DNA interactions and the role of electronic-vibrational coherence in electronic energy migration within exciton-coupled bio-molecular arrays.},

abstract = {The homoleptic Co(-I) isonitrile complex [Co(CNPh∗)4]- (1-, Ph∗ = 2,6-C6H3Me2), the first example of an isonitrilate complex, can be prepared by ethylene substitution within the Co(-I) complex [Co(C2H4)4]- or by potassium naphthalenide (K(Nap)) reduction of Co(0), Co(I), and Co(II) substrates. Reductions of the isonitrile-containing precursors [Co(CNPh∗)4I2] (3) and [Co(CNPh∗)5]+ (4+) proceed via [Co2(CNPh∗)8] (2), which is then reduced further to 1-. Complex 1- can be prepared in one pot by K(Nap) reduction of cobaltocene followed by addition of CNPh∗ or by potassium reduction of a mixture of CoI2 and CNPh∗ to give 2, which is then further reduced to 1-. The anion 1- can be isolated as K+, [K(DME)]+, [K(crypt-2,2,2)]+, and [K(18-C-6)]+ salts and has been characterized spectroscopically and analytically. Oxidation of 1- gives 2, which is the only observable product from the reaction of 1- with many simple electrophiles. The only electrophilic adduct of 1- isolated to date is [Co(CNPh∗)4(SnPh3)] (5), the product of reaction with Ph3SnCl. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction has confirmed that [K(DME)]1 contains discrete, approximately tetrahedral cobalt anions held together as loose dimers through interactions with the [K(DME)]+ counterions (space group Pl. with a = 11.160(2) {\AA}, b = 14.204(3) {\AA}, c = 14.339(3) {\AA}, $\alpha$ = 102.91(1)°, $\beta$ = 111.88(1)°, $\gamma$ = 102.78(1)°, Dc = 1.223 g/mL, Z = 2, and RF = 5.93{\%}). Crystallography has also established that 2 is a dimer with two bridging isonitrile groups (space group Pi, with a = 12.239(4) {\AA}, b = 13.985(4) {\AA}, c = 21.609(6) {\AA}, $\alpha$ = 98.87(2)°, $\beta$ = 99.19(2)°, $\gamma$ = 112.72(2)°, Dc = 1.185 g/mL, Z = 2, and RF = 6.10{\%}), and examination of molecular parameters for 1- and 2 suggest that increased back-donation of electron density from the metal results in significant lengthening of the C=N triple bond in 1- but has no consistent effect on the CNC bend angles of the ligands. Decreases in the CNC angles correlate instead with close approaches between the carbon atoms of the ligands and the [K(DME)]+ counterions, which are also responsible for the major distortions of the metal geometry away from that of an ideal tetrahedron. {\textcopyright} 1994, American Chemical Society.

Moreover, we suggest that the relative entropy provides a rigorous framework for multiscale simulations and offers new numerical techniques for linking models at different scales.

abstract = {A strategy is developed for generating equilibrated high molecular weight polymer melts described with microscopic detail by sequentially backmapping coarse-grained (CG) configurations. The microscopic test model is generic but retains features like hard excluded volume interactions and realistic melt densities. The microscopic representation is mapped onto a model of soft spheres with fluctuating size, where each sphere represents a microscopic subchain with Nb monomers. By varying Nb, a hierarchy of CG representations at different resolutions is obtained. Within this hierarchy, CG configurations equilibrated with Monte Carlo at low resolution are sequentially fine-grained into CG melts described with higher resolution. A Molecular Dynamics scheme is employed to slowly introduce the microscopic details into the latter. All backmapping steps involve only local polymer relaxation; thus, the computational efficiency of the scheme is independent of molecular weight, being just proportional to system size. To...},

abstract = {Organic electronics is a popular and rapidly growing field of research. The optical, electrical and mechanical properties of organic molecules and materials can be tailored using increasingly well controlled synthetic methods. The challenge and fascination with this field of research is derived from the fact that not only the chemical identity, but also the spatial arrangement of the molecules critically affects the performance of the material. Thus synthetic, fabrication, characterisation and computational scientists need to work closely to relate a materials performance in a device to the molecular details that cause and optimise that performance. For computational scientists in particular, the need to relate macroscopic device performance to details of molecular electronic structure brings challenges in methodology due to the need to bridge many orders of time and length scales. This article provides a survey of computational methods applied to multiple-length and time scale problems in organic electro...},

abstract = {Abstract This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz.

A force constant analysis is presented which, in conjunction with the molecular orbital results, shows that both $\sigma$- and $\pi$-bonding changes in the metal to isocyanide bond can influence observed stretching frequencies. The antibonding behavior of the 7a1 orbital, the carbon “lone pair” inmethyl isocyanide, helps explain the observed increase in kn values for bound methyl isocyanide compared to the free ligand in many metal complexes even though there is significant back-bonding to the ligand. We also find that for the cationic manganese species electrochemical potentials for the +1 → +2 oxidation process correlate extremely well with calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies. These results confirm the importance of including near-neighbor interactions in an approximate molecular orbital scheme. {\textcopyright} 1975, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

abstract = {The major source of errror in most ab initio calculations of molecular energies is the truncation of the one-electron basis set. A complete basis set model chemistry is defined to include corrections for basis set truncation errors. This model uses double zeta plus polarization level atomic pair natural orbital basis sets to calculate molecular self-consistent-field (SCF) energies and correlation energies. The small corrections to give the complete basis set SCF energies are then estimated using the l-6 asymptotic convergence of the multicenter angular momentum expansion. The calculated correlation energies of the atoms He, Be, and Ne, and of the hydrides LiH, BH3, CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF, using the double zeta plus polarization basis sets vary from 83.0{\%} to 91.2{\%} of the experimental correlation energies. However, extrapolation of each of the pair energies and pair-coupling terms to the complete basis set values using the asymptotic convergence of pair natural orbital expansions retrieves from 99.5 ± 0.7{\%} to 101.1 ± 0.6{\%} of the experimental correlation energies for these atoms and molecules. With the exception of ammonia which gave 101.1{\%}, the calculated correlation energies agree with the experimental values to within the error limits of the experiments for all these atoms and molecules with more than four electrons. The total extrapolated energies (ESCF + E Correlation) are then in agreement with experiment to within ± 0.0014 hartree (root mean square deviation) and represent the most accurate total energy calculations yet reported for the molecules.

Here, we develop a broad theoretical framework for this methodology and numerical strategies for its use in practical coarse-graining settings. In particular, we show that the relative entropy offers tight control over the errors due to coarse-graining in arbitrary microscopic properties, and suggests a systematic approach to reducing them. We also describe fundamental connections between this optimization methodology and other coarse-graining strategies like inverse Monte Carlo, force matching, energy matching, and variational mean-field theory. We suggest several new numerical approaches to its minimization that provide new coarse-graining strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the application of these theoretical considerations and algorithms to a simple, instructive system and characterize convergence and errors within the relative entropy framework.},

abstract = {An account is given of the development of the SHELX system of computer programs from SHELX-76 to the present day. In addition to identifying useful innovations that have come into general use through their implementation in SHELX, a critical analysis is presented of the less-successful features, missed opportunities and desirable improvements for future releases of the software. An attempt is made to understand how a program originally designed for photographic intensity data, punched cards and computers over 10000 times slower than an average modern personal computer has managed to survive for so long. SHELXL is the most widely used program for small-molecule refinement and SHELXS and SHELXD are often employed for structure solution despite the availability of objectively superior programs. SHELXL also finds a niche for the refinement of macromolecules against high-resolution or twinned data; SHELXPRO acts as an interface for macromolecular applications. SHELXC, SHELXD and SHELXE are proving useful for the experimental phasing of macromolecules, especially because they are fast and robust and so are often employed in pipelines for high-throughput phasing. This paper could serve as a general literature citation when one or more of the open-source SHELX programs (and the Bruker AXS version SHELXTL) are employed in the course of a crystal-structure determination. {\textcopyright} International Union of Crystallography 2008.},

abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) have been demonstrated to be a powerful method for computationally studying intramolecular processes such as protein folding and macromolecular conformational changes. In this article, we present a new approach to construct MSMs that is applicable to modeling a broad class of multi-molecular assembly reactions. Distinct structures formed during assembly are distinguished by their undirected graphs, which are defined by strong subunit interactions. Spatial inhomogeneities of free subunits are accounted for using a recently developed Gaussian-based signature. Simplifications to this state identification are also investigated. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated on two different coarse-grained models for virus self-assembly. We find good agreement between the dynamics predicted by the MSMs and long, unbiased simulations, and that the MSMs can reduce overall simulation time by orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {We present a hierarchical approach that combines atomistic and mesoscopic simulations that can generally be applied to vinyl polymers. As a test case, the approach is applied to atactic polystyrene (PS). First, a specific model for atactic PS is chosen. The bonded parameters in the coarse-grained force field, based on data obtained from atomistic simulations of isolated PS dimers, are chosen in a way which allows to differentiate between meso and racemic dyads. This approach in principle allows to study isotactic and syndiotactic melts as well. Nonbonded interactions between coarse-grained beads were chosen as purely repulsive. The proposed mesoscopic model reproduces both the local structure and the chain dimensions properly. An explicit time mapping is performed, based on the atomistic and CG mean-square displacements of short chains, demonstrating an effective speed up of about 3 orders of magnitude compared to brute force atomistic simulations. Finally the equilibrated coarse-grained chains are back mapped onto the atomistic systems. This opens new routes for obtaining well equilibrated high molecular weight polymeric systems and also providing very long dynamic trajectories at the atomistic level for these polymers.},

abstract = {Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are a topic of extensive research because of their potential application in solar cells. Recent work has led to the development of a coarse-grained model for studying poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blends using molecular simulations. Here we provide further validation of the force field and use it to study the thermal annealing process of P3HT:PCBM blends. A key finding of our study is that, in contrast to a previous report, the annealing process does not converge at the short time scales reported. Rather, we find that the self-assembly of the blends is characterized by three rate dependent stages that require much longer simulations to approach convergence. Using state-of-the-art high performance computing, we are able to study annealing at length and time scales commensurate with devices used in experiments. Our simulations show different phase segregated morphologies dependent on the P3HT chain length and PCBM volume fraction in the blend. For short chain lengths, we observed a smectic morphology containing alternate P3HT and PCBM domains. In contrast, a phase segregated morphology containing domains of P3HT and PCBM distributed randomly in space is found for longer chain lengths. Theoretical arguments justifying stabilization of these morphologies due to shape anisotropy of P3HT (rod-like) and PCBM (sphere-like) are presented. Furthermore, results on the structure factor, miscibility of P3HT and PCBM, domain spacing and kinetics of phase segregation in the blends are presented in detail. Qualitative comparison of these results with published small-angle neutron scattering experiments in the literature is presented and an excellent agreement is found.},

The use of atomcentered basis functions allows treating 3D (crystals), 2D (slabs), 1D (polymers), and 0D (molecules) systems on the same grounds. In turn, all-electron calculations are inherently permitted along with pseudopotential strategies. A variety of density functionals are implemented, including global and range-separated hybrids of various natures and, as an extreme case, Hartree Fock (HF). The cost for HF or hybrids is only about 3 5 times higher than when using the local density approximation or the generalized gradient approximation. Symmetry is fully exploited at all steps of the calculation. Many tools are available to modify the structure as given in input and simplify the construction of complicated objects, such as slabs, nanotubes, molecules, and clusters. Many tensorial properties can be evaluated by using a single input keyword: elastic, piezoelectric, photoelastic, dielectric, first and second hyperpolarizabilities, etc. The calculation of infrared and Raman spectra is available, and the intensities are computed analytically. Automated tools are available for the generation of the relevant configurations of solid solutions and/or disordered systems. Three versions of the code exist: serial, parallel, and massive-parallel. In the second one, the most relevant matrices are duplicated on each core, whereas in the third one, the Fock matrix is distributed for diagonalization.

@article{Blischak2016,
abstract = {Many scientists write code as part of their research. Just as expriments are logged in laboratory notebooks, it is important to document the code you use for analysis. However, a few key problems can arise when iteratively developing code that make it difficult to document and track which code version was used to create each result. First, you often need to experiment with new ideas, such as adding new features to a script or increasing the speed of a slow step, but you do not want to risk breaking the currently working code. One often-utilized solution is to make a copy of the script before making new edits. However, this can quickly become a problem because it clutters your file system with uninformative filenames, e.g., analisys.sh, analysis{\_}02.sh, analysis{\_}03.sh, etc. It is difficult to remember the differences between the verions of the files and, more importantly, which version you used to produce specific results, especially if you return to the code months later. Second, you will likely share your code with multiple lab mates or collaborators, and they may have suggestions on how to improve it. If you email the code to multiple people, you will have to manually incorporate all the changes of them sends. Fortunately, software engineers have already developed software to manage these issues: version control. A version control system (VCS) allows you to track the iterative changes you make to your code, Thus, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results. Furthermore, you can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. It also facilitates collaboration. Using a VCS, your collaborators can make and save changes to the code, and you can automatically incorporate these changes to the main code base. The collaborative aspect is enhanced with the emergence of websites that host version-controlled code.},

abstract = {The capabilities of the Crystal14 program are presented, and the improvements made with respect to the previous Crystal09 version discussed. Crystal14 is an ab initio code that uses a Gaussian-type basis set: both pseudopotential and all-electron strategies are permitted; the latter is not much more expensive than the former up to the first-second transition metal rows of the periodic table. A variety of density functionals is available, including as an extreme case Hartree-Fock; hybrids of various nature (global, range-separated, double) can be used. In particular, a very efficient implementation of global hybrids, such as popular B3LYP and PBE0 prescriptions, allows for such calculations to be performed at relatively low computational cost. The program can treat on the same grounds zero-dimensional (molecules), one-dimensional (polymers), two-dimensional (slabs), as well as three-dimensional (3D; crystals) systems. No spurious 3D periodicity is required for low-dimensional systems as happens when plane-waves are used as a basis set. Symmetry is fully exploited at all steps of the calculation; this permits, for example, to investigate nanotubes of increasing radius at a nearly constant cost (better than linear scaling!) or to perform self-consistent-field (SCF) calculations on fullerenes as large as (10,10), with 6000 atoms, 84,000 atomic orbitals, and 20 SCF cycles, on a single core in one day. Three versions of the code exist, serial, parallel, and massive-parallel. In the second one, the most relevant matrices are duplicated, whereas in the third one the matrices in reciprocal space are distributed for diagonalization. All the relevant vectors are now dynamically allocated and deallocated after use, making Crystal14 much more agile than the previous version, in which they were statically allocated. The program now fits more easily in low-memory machines (as many supercomputers nowadays are). Crystal14 can be used on parallel machines up to a high number of cores (benchmarks up to 10,240 cores are documented) with good scalability, the main limitation remaining the diagonalization step. Many tensorial properties can be evaluated in a fully automated way by using a single input keyword: elastic, piezoelectric, photoelastic, dielectric, as well as first and second hyperpolarizabilies, electric field gradients, Born tensors and so forth. Many tools permit a complete analysis of the vibrational properties of crystalline compounds. The infrared and Raman intensities are now computed analytically and related spectra can be generated. Isotopic shifts are easily evaluated, frequencies of only a fragment of a large system computed and nuclear contribution to the dielectric tensor determined. New algorithms have been devised for the investigation of solid solutions and disordered systems. The topological analysis of the electron charge density, according to the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules, is now incorporated in the code via the integrated merge of the Topond package. Electron correlation can be evaluated at the M{\"{o}}ller-Plesset second-order level (namely MP2) and a set of double-hybrids are presently available via the integrated merge with the Cryscor program. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A set of carefully designed and characterized experiments provides validation data for the simulations that predict the molecular structure and properties of the thermoset. Our results show that current state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations provide quantitative predictions for this epoxy system in its glassy state, including elastic moduli, coefficient of thermal expansion and specific heat. The glass transition temperature is also accurately predicted once a correction is included to account for the difference in cooling rates between the simulations and experiments. Our results also indicate that viscoelastic and thermal properties of the thermoset polymer in its rubbery state are more challenging to predict since the effect of timescales is not well understood. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) contains a complete record of all published organic and metal-organic small-molecule crystal structures. The database has been in operation for over 50 years and continues to be the primary means of sharing structural chemistry data and knowledge across disciplines. As well as structures that are made public to support scientific articles, it includes many structures published directly as CSD Communications. All structures are processed both computationally and by expert structural chemistry editors prior to entering the database. A key component of this processing is the reliable association of the chemical identity of the structure studied with the experimental data. This important step helps ensure that data is widely discoverable and readily reusable. Content is further enriched through selective inclusion of additional experimental data. Entries are available to anyone through free CSD community web services. Linking services developed and maintained by the CCDC, combined with the use of standard identifiers, facilitate discovery from other resources. Data can also be accessed through CCDC and third party software applications and through an application programming interface.This paper is the definitive article describing the creation, maintenance, information content and availability of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), the world's repository of small molecule crystal structures.},

abstract = {The new computer program SHELXT employs a novel dual-space algorithm to solve the phase problem for single-crystal reflection data expanded to the space group P1. Missing data are taken into account and the resolution extended if necessary. All space groups in the specified Laue group are tested to find which are consistent with the P1 phases. After applying the resulting origin shifts and space-group symmetry, the solutions are subject to further dual-space recycling followed by a peak search and summation of the electron density around each peak. Elements are assigned to give the best fit to the integrated peak densities and if necessary additional elements are considered. An isotropic refinement is followed for non-centrosymmetric space groups by the calculation of a Flack parameter and, if appropriate, inversion of the structure. The structure is assembled to maximize its connectivity and centred optimally in the unit cell. SHELXT has already solved many thousand structures with a high success rate, and is optimized for multiprocessor computers. It is, however, unsuitable for severely disordered and twinned structures because it is based on the assumption that the structure consists of atoms.},

abstract = {Phase separation process in poly(-caprolactone)-epoxy blends (PCL-epoxy) cured by 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) was investigated by OM and SEM. The blend compositions higher than the critical point exhibit macrophase separation by the spinodal decomposition (SD) mechanism of the epoxy and results in the epoxy particles being dispersed in the matrix. These epoxy particles grow larger gradually and connect to each other to give macrophase epoxy domains with irregular shape. After that, two more stages of microphase separations take place via a nucleation and growth (NG) mechanism and result in smaller epoxy particles being dispersed in the matrix. Blend compositions lower than the critical point exhibit the SD or NG mechanisms of PCL, but the microphase separation is observed only within the epoxy matrix. These phase separation mechanisms can be illustrated successfully by the phase diagram constructed by the spinodal and binodal curves. Hydrogen bonding between protons from the epoxy with carbonyls from PCL has been investigated by FTIR. The mixing free energy reduction by the hydrogen bonding can contribute to the LCST behavior rather than the UCST behavior predicted by the Flory-Huggins equation based on only nonpolar interactions.},

Abstract We establish a reliable and robust standardization of settings for practical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of pure and mixed (single-and multi-component) lipid bilayer membranes. In lipid membranes research, particle-based molecular simulations are a powerful tool alongside continuum theory, lipidomics, and model, in vitro, and in vivo experiments. Molecular simulations can provide precise and reproducible spatiotemporal (atomic-and femtosecond-level) information about membrane structure, mechanics, thermodynamics, kinetics, and dynamics. Yet the simulation of lipid membranes can be a daunting task, given the uniqueness of lipid membranes relative to conventional liquid-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces, the immense and complex thermodynamic and statistical mechanical theory, the diversity of multiscale lipid models, limitations of modern computing power, the diculty and ambiguity of simulation controls, nite size effects, competitive continuum simulation alternatives, and the desired application, including vesicle experiments and biological membranes. These issues can complicate an essential understanding of the eld of lipid membranes, and create major bottlenecks to simulation advancement. In this article, we clarify these issues and present a consistent, thorough, and user-friendly framework for the design of state-of-the-art lipid membrane MD simulations. We hope to allow early-career researchers to quickly overcome common obstacles in the eld of lipid membranes and reach maximal impact in their simulations.},

abstract = {We develop a generic coarse-grained model of soluble conjugated polymers, capable of describing their self-assembly into a lamellar mesophase. Polymer chains are described by a hindered-rotation model, where interaction centers represent entire repeat units, including side chains. We introduce soft anisotropic nonbonded interactions to mimic the potential of mean force between atomistic repeat units. The functional form of this potential reflects the symmetry of the molecular order in a lamellar mesophase. The model can generate both nematic and lamellar (sanidic smectic) molecular arrangements. We parametrize this model for a soluble conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and demonstrate that the simulated lamellar mesophase matches morphologies of low molecular weight P3HT, experimentally observed at elevated temperatures. A qualitative charge-transport model allows us to link local chain conformations and mesoscale order to charge transport. In particular, it shows how coarsening of lamellar domains and chain extension increase the charge carrier mobility. By modeling large systems and long chains, we can capture transport between lamellar layers, which is due to rare, but thermodynamically allowed, backbone bridges between neighboring layers.},

The X-ray structure of [CuL3(SO4)] shows that the sulfate anion is involved in cooperative binding via coordination to the metal ion and hydrogen-bonding to the urea unit. This behaviour is similar to that observed for the related receptor L1 [1-(2-((bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino)methyl)phenyl)-3-(3-nitrophenyl)urea], which forms a dimeric [CuL1($\mu$-SO4)]2 structure in the solid state. In contrast, the single crystal X-ray structure of [ZnL3(NO3)2] contains a 1 : 2 complex (metal : anion) where one anion coordinates to the metal and the other is hydrogen-bonded to the urea group.

abstract = {Due to the relatively long time scales inherent to ionic surfactant self-assembly ({\textgreater}$\mu$s), an aggressive computational approach is needed to obtain converged data on micellar solutions. This work presents a study of micellization using a coarse-grained (CG) model of aqueous ionic surfactants in replicated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations run on graphics processing unit hardware. The performance of our implementation of the CG model with electrostatics into the HOOMD-Blue GPU-accelerated MD software package is comparable to that of a modest sized cluster running a highly optimized parallel CPU code. From 0.36 ms of cumulative trajectory data, we are able to predict equilibrium thermodynamic and morphological properties of ionic surfactant micellar solutions. Estimating the critical micelle concentrations (CMC) from the free monomer ($\rho$ 1) and premicellar concentrations obtained from simulations of sodium hexyl sulfate (S6S, CMC of 460 ± 6 mM) at high (1 M) concentration, a value in good agreement with experimental results is obtained; however, the same method applied to simulations of sodium nonyl sulfate (S9S, $\rho$ 1 of 2.4 ± 0.01 mM) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, $\rho$ 1 of 0.02 ± 0.01 mM) at the same total concentration systematically underestimates the CMCs. An alternative method for calculating the CMC is presented, where the free monomer concentration computed from high concentration CG-MD data is used as the input to a simple theoretical model which can be used to extrapolate to a more accurate prediction of the CMC. Better agreement between the empirical and predicted CMC is obtained from this theory for S9S (28.7 ± 0.3 mM) and SDS (3.32 ± 0.04 mM), though the CMC for S6S is slightly underestimated (304 ± 3 mM). We also present statistically converged morphological data, including aggregation number distributions and the principal components of the gyration tensor. This data suggest a transition from spherical micelles to rod-like at a specific aggregation number, which increases with increasing hydrocarbon length. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Molecular Dynamics is a powerful methodology for the comprehension at molecular level of many chemical and biochemical systems. The theories and techniques developed for structural and thermodynamic analyses are well established, and many software packages are available. However, designing starting configurations for dynamics can be cumbersome. Easily generated regular lattices can be used when simple liquids or mixtures are studied. However, for complex mixtures, polymer solutions or solid adsorbed liquids (for example) this approach is inefficient, and it turns out to be very hard to obtain an adequate coordinate file. In this article, the problem of obtaining an adequate initial configuration is treated as a “packing” problem and solved by an optimization procedure. The initial configuration is chosen in such a way that the minimum distance between atoms of different molecules is greater than a fixed tolerance. The optimization uses a well-known algorithm for box-constrained minimization. Applications are given for biomolecule solvation, many-component mixtures, and interfaces. This approach can reduce the work of designing starting configurations from days or weeks to few minutes or hours, in an automated fashion. Packing optimization is also shown to be a powerful methodology for space search in docking of small ligands to proteins. This is demonstrated by docking of the thyroid hormone to its nuclear receptor.},

abstract = {The reproduction and replication of research results has become a major issue for a number of scientific disciplines. In computer science and related computational disciplines such as systems biology, the challenges closely revolve around the ability to implement (and exploit) novel algorithms and models. Taking a new approach from the literature and applying it to a new codebase frequently requires local knowledge missing from the published manuscripts and transient project websites. Alongside this issue, benchmarking, and the lack of open, transparent and fair benchmark sets present another barrier to the verification and validation of claimed results. In this paper, we outline several recommendations to address these issues, driven by specific examples from a range of scientific domains. Based on these recommendations, we propose a high-level prototype open automated platform for scientific software development which effectively abstracts specific dependencies from the individual researcher and their workstation, allowing easy sharing and reproduction of results. This new e-infrastructure for reproducible computational science offers the potential to incentivise a culture change and drive the adoption of new techniques to improve the quality and efficiency -- and thus reproducibility -- of scientific exploration.},

abstract = {In this study, we developed a multiscale molecular simulation framework including coarse-grained (CG) molecular simulation, reverse-mapping, and morphology evaluation schemes to investigate the nanoscale morphologies of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend films comprising poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the methanofullerene derivative PCBM. A stable and phase-separated blend film with the fibrillar P3HT structure was observed after CG simulation of the thermal annealing process, and by the reverse-mapping technique the atomistic details - showing strong $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction between thiophene rings - were retrieved. To evaluate the morphologies of P3HT:PCBM blends, a spatial-discretization scheme was developed. With such a scheme, we estimated the average domain sizes, interface-to-volume ratios, and percolation ratios of the blends at different P3HT:PCBM weight ratios. The average domain sizes determined through these simulations were in excellent agreement with those reported experimentally. Moreover, our simulations indicated that blend films having weight ratios close to 1:1 would have the highest interface-to-volume ratio and the most balanced charge carrier transport in both the P3HT and PCBM phases, consistent with the experimental observation that a 1:1 weight ratio is optimal for P3HT:PCBM blends. The multiscale molecular simulation framework proposed herein can be extended to investigating the morphologies of other photoactive layers of organic photovoltaic cells. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The structure of 1 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography.

The presence of the urea functionality caused an increase in the oxidation potential of the p-phenylenediamine subunit compared to that of free p-phenylenediamine. Electrochemical studies of the anion complexes revealed two-wave behavior with the appearance of a second oxidation wave cathodic to that in the free receptors and characteristic of the bound anion.

abstract = {'Bottom-up fabrication', which exploits the intrinsic properties of atoms and molecules to direct their self-organization, is widely used to make relatively simple nanostructures. A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by 'top-down' methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide 'staple strands' to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).},

abstract = {An empirical correction to density functional theory (DFT) has been developed in this study. The approach, called correlation corrected atomization-dispersion (CCAZD), involves short- and long-range terms. Short-range correction consists of bond (1,2-) and angle (1,3-) interactions, which remedies the deficiency of DFT in describing the proto-branching stabilization effects. Long-range correction includes a Buckingham potential function aiming to account for the dispersion interactions. The empirical corrections of DFT were parameterized to reproduce reported $\Delta$H ( f ) values of the training set containing alkane, alcohol and ether molecules. The $\Delta$H ( f ) of the training set molecules predicted by the CCAZD method combined with two different DFT methods, B3LYP and MPWB1K, with a 6-31G* basis set agreed well with the experimental data. For 106 alkane, alcohol and ether compounds, the average absolute deviations (AADs) in $\Delta$H ( f ) were 0.45 and 0.51 kcal/mol for B3LYP- and MPWB1K-CCAZD, respectively. Calculations of isomerization energies, rotational barriers and conformational energies further validated the CCAZD approach. The isomerization energies improved significantly with the CCAZD treatment. The AADs for 22 energies of isomerization reactions were decreased from 3.55 and 2.44 to 0.55 and 0.82 kcal/mol for B3LYP and MPWB1K, respectively. This study also provided predictions of MM4, G3, CBS-QB3 and B2PLYP-D for comparison. The final test of the CCAZD approach on the calculation of the cellobiose analog potential surface also showed promising results. This study demonstrated that DFT calculations with CCAZD empirical corrections achieved very good agreement with reported values for various chemical reactions with a small basis set as 6-31G*.},

However, the vast landscape of possible building blocks makes predicting the final behavior of tethered nanoparticles a priori a challenging task. Concepts from the computer science field of modeling integrated computing may provide an efficient means to optimize this complex design problem. Here, we investigate the use of model integrated computing for the simulation of tethered nanoparticles. We outline our development of a 'meta-programming' tool that enables the creation of a domain specific modeling language for tethered nanoparticle simulation and also provides tools for the creation and synthesis of simulation workflows. To test these tools and provide insight into their behavior, we report calculations of the vapor-liquid equilibrium of tethered nanoparticles as a function of grafting density and grafting length.

abstract = {In this paper we aim at predicting material properties of a cross-linked polymer by using multi-scale simulations and to compare the elastic properties and glass transition temperature with experimentally observed values. To that purpose we use an epoxy polymer for which the starting point is a mesoscopic simulation of its cross-linked structure realized by Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations, as recently improved to conserve local densities properly. This results in a coarse-grained structure of this thermoset polymer, relaxed at a large length- and long time-scale. Such a mesoscopic simulation is important as otherwise insufficient relaxation of the structures occurs for a later and proper comparison with experimental properties. Allowing further simulations at the atomistic scale using molecular dynamics (or any other method) to obtain material properties, a reverse-mapping procedure is required to insert atomistic detail into the coarse-grained structures. Hence, an efficient and reliable reverse-mapping procedure was implemented to be able to connect these two types of simulation. For the epoxy polymer chosen, Poisson's ratio, the elastic modulus, the glass transition temperature and the thermal expansion coefficients of the glassy and rubbery state resulting from the equilibrated reverse-mapped structure, match the experimental values well. Overall, the paper reports a fast and straightforward procedure to bridge a mesoscopic structure to experimentally observed material properties, which can be applied to any system of interest.},

Stable with 20 fs when rings. Less than 20 considered inefficient.
PMF's of fullerenes look good! (39)
Micelle self-assembly is a good Martini application.
Temperature dependence not great? (Limitations)
Oooh, check out nafion ionomers (274)
Nanoparticles covered with PMMA (278)
Limitations: 
Shifted balance of enthalpy and entropy due to reduced number of degrees of freedom; kinetics that are unpredictable.
Phosphatidylcholine lipids should have melting temperatures that depend on the acyl chain, but can't get 14 carbons if the carbons usually come in blobs of 4 (12 to 16)
Atomistic time scales are well-defined, and things like water diffusion are used to judge the quality of the underlying model.
CG Methods smooth PE surface; increase sampling time; not predictable for all degrees of freedom.
Semi-universal factor of a speed up of 4.
Martini particles with 72amu masses or 45 amu masses for scaled particles; scales time by different amounts for different underlying masses.
Free energies; enthalpies, entropies: Reducing the degrees of freedom is compensated for by reducing the enthalpic terms in model, but makes temperature-dependence apriori not conrrect; free energy breakdown not correct, but free energy differences OK. 
Things better in apolar environments.
12-6 not best for nonbonded: overstructuring of fluids compared to atomistic models: Martini water prone to freezing at room T.
Secondary Structure Constraints: 
Martini's sophisticated side chains but simple backbone- secondary structure constraints to maintain extended and helical secondary structures by strengthening bonded interactions to maintain a preset secondary structure; situations where proteins or peptides change structure considerably cannot be reliably handled.
Pseudo-dihedrals (ref 178) may help
Directionality of H-bonds needs to be restored for certain molecules. (316-320)
Fixed dipoles for backbone polarity may also help.
*Systematic approach in ref 31 for building nucleic acids.

DFT calculations performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level show that this selectivity is due to a cooperative twosite binding of Neu5A.c through 1) ester formation by interaction at the phenylboronic acid function of the receptor and 2) hydrogen-bond interaction between the thiourea moiety and the carboxylate group of Neu5Ac. Compound 3a can therefore be considered a promising synthon for the design of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging of tumors. In contrast, the analogue of 3a containing a urea moiety compound 3b - displays strong binding to all monosaccharides investigated, due to two-site binding through interaction on the phenylboronic acid function of the receptor and a hydrogen-bond interaction between the urea moiety and the sugar hydroxy groups. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

abstract = {Chiral macrocyclic receptors 1 with multiple hydrogen-bonding sites in the cavity were synthesized and used as NMR chiral solvating agents (CSAs). The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction gave rapid access to a series of variants 1b-p of unsubstituted parent compound 1a. Among them, 1d with the 4-cyanophenyl group at the 3,3′-positions of the binaphthyl moiety was the most excellent CSA for a benchmark analyte compound, 2-chloropropionic acid (CPA); both of the quartet and doublet signals of CPA were split most completely in CDCl3. Binding constants (Ka) determined in CDCl3 by NMR titrations indicated that (R)-1d was the most enantioselective (Ka(S)/Ka(R) = 5.4). Interestingly, the Ka value of (R)-1d for (S)-CPA (5900) was greater than that of (R)-1a for (S)-CPA (3080), which strongly suggests an attractive interaction between the 4-cyanophenyl group of (R)-1d and (S)-CPA. The X-ray crystal structure of 1d indicates that one of the two H atoms meta to the cyano group is directed toward the cavity. DFT calculations suggested that this H atom of the 4-cyanophenyl group of (R)-1d forms a weak hydrogen bond with the Cl atom of (S)-CPA (C-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}Cl-C hydrogen bond).},

abstract = {Approaches for computing small molecule binding free energies based on molecular simulations are now regularly being employed by academic and industry practitioners to study receptor-ligand systems and prioritize the synthesis of small molecules for ligand design. Given the variety of methods and implementations available, it is natural to ask how the convergence rates and final predictions of these methods compare. In this study, we describe the concept and results for the SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge, the first challenge from the SAMPL series focusing on the assessment of convergence properties and reproducibility of binding free energy methodologies. We provided parameter files, partial charges, and multiple initial geometries for two octa-acid (OA) and one cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) host–guest systems. Participants submitted binding free energy predictions as a function of the number of force and energy evaluations for seven different alchemical and physical-pathway (i.e., potential of mean force and weighted ensemble of trajectories) methodologies implemented with the GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, or OpenMM simulation engines. To rank the methods, we developed an efficiency statistic based on bias and variance of the free energy estimates. For the two small OA binders, the free energy estimates computed with alchemical and potential of mean force approaches show relatively similar variance and bias as a function of the number of energy/force evaluations, with the attach-pull-release (APR), GROMACS expanded ensemble, and NAMD double decoupling submissions obtaining the greatest efficiency. The differences between the methods increase when analyzing the CB8-quinine system, where both the guest size and correlation times for system dynamics are greater. For this system, nonequilibrium switching (GROMACS/NS-DS/SB) obtained the overall highest efficiency. Surprisingly, the results suggest that specifying force field parameters and partial charges is insufficient to generally ensure reproducibility, and we observe differences between seemingly converged predictions ranging approximately from 0.3 to 1.0 kcal/mol, even with almost identical simulations parameters and system setup (e.g., Lennard-Jones cutoff, ionic composition). Further work will be required to completely identify the exact source of these discrepancies. Among the conclusions emerging from the data, we found that Hamiltonian replica exchange—while displaying very small variance—can be affected by a slowly-decaying bias that depends on the initial population of the replicas, that bidirectional estimators are significantly more efficient than unidirectional estimators for nonequilibrium free energy calculations for systems considered, and that the Berendsen barostat introduces non-negligible artifacts in expanded ensemble simulations.},

These efforts face significant challenges due to the varied computing skill-sets of learners, requirements of degree programs, and the absence of a common programming standard. Instructional scaffolding and active learning methods that use Python offer avenues to support students with varied learning needs. Here, we report on quantitative and qualitative outcomes from three distinct models of programming education that (i) connect coding to hands-on "maker" activities; (ii) incremental learning of computational thinking elements through guided exercises that use Jupyter Notebooks; and (iii) problem-based learning with step-wise code fragments leading to algorithmic implementation. Performance in class activities, capstone projects, in-person interviews, and participant surveys informed us about the effectiveness of these approaches on student learning. We find that students with previous coding experience were able to rely on broader skills and grasp concepts faster than students who recently attended an introductory programming session. We find that, while makerspace activities were engaging and explained basic programming concepts, they lost their appeal in complex programming scenarios. Students grasped coding concepts fastest using the Jupyter notebooks, while the problem-based learning approach was best at having students understand the core problem and create inventive means to address them.},

We demonstrate the first implementation of custom temperature-time curing profiles with dissipative particle dynamics and show that reaction kinetics depend sensitively on the stochastic bonding rates. We provide guidelines for modeling first-order reaction dynamics in a classic epoxy/hardener/toughener system and show structural sensitivity to the temperature-time profile during cure. We conclude with a discussion of how these efficient large-scale simulations can be used to evaluate ensembles of epoxy processing protocols to quantify the sensitivity of microstructure on processing.},

abstract = {While the transferable potentials for phase equilibria-united atom (TraPPE-UA) force field has generally been successful at providing parameters that are highly transferable between different molecules, the polarity and polarizability of a given functional group can be significantly perturbed in small cyclic structures, which limits the transferability of parameters obtained for linear molecules. This has motivated us to develop a version of the TraPPE-UA force field specifically for five- and six-membered cyclic alkanes and ethers. The Lennard-Jones parameters for the methylene group obtained from cyclic alkanes are transferred to the ethers for each ring size, and those for the oxygen atom are common to all compounds for a given ring size. However, the partial charges are molecule specific and parametrized using liquid-phase dielectric constants. This model yields accurate saturated liquid densities and vapor pressures, critical temperatures and densities, normal boiling points, heat capacities, and isothermal compressibilities for the following molecules: cyclopentane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxolane, cyclohexane, oxane, 1,4-dioxane, 1,3-dioxane, and 1,3,5-trioxane. The azeotropic behavior and separation factor for the binary mixtures of 1,3-dioxolane/cyclohexane and ethanol/1,4-dioxane are qualitively reproduced.},

@article{Lindahl2008,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins are making rapid progress, because of new high-resolution structures, advances in computer hardware and atomistic simulation algorithms, and the recent introduction of coarse-grained models for membranes and proteins. In addition to several large ion channel simulations, recent studies have explored how individual amino acids interact with the bilayer or snorkel/anchor to the headgroup region, and it has been possible to calculate water/membrane partition free energies. This has resulted in a view of bilayers as being adaptive rather than purely hydrophobic solvents, with important implications, for example, for interaction between lipids and arginines in the charged S4 helix of voltage-gated ion channels. However, several studies indicate that the typical current simulations fall short of exhaustive sampling, and that even simple protein-membrane interactions require at least ca. 1 $\mu$s to fully sample their dynamics. One new way this is being addressed is coarse-grained models that enable mesoscopic simulations on multi-$\mu$s scale. These have been used to model interactions, self-assembly and membrane perturbations induced by proteins. While they cannot replace all-atom simulations, they are a potentially useful technique for initial insertion, placement, and low-resolution refinement. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that the energy calculations for all molecular dynamics engines for this molecular set agree to better than 0.1 {\%} relative absolute energy for all energy components, and in most cases an order of magnitude better, when reasonable choices are made for different cutoff parameters. However, there are some surprising sources of statistically significant differences. Most importantly, different choices of Coulomb's constant between programs are one of the largest sources of discrepancies in energies. We discuss the measures required to get good agreement in the energies for equivalent starting configurations between the simulation programs, and the energy differences that occur when simulations are run with program-specific default simulation parameter values.

abstract = {A delicate balance of different types of intramolecular interactions makes the folded states of proteins marginally more stable than the unfolded states. Experiments use thermal, chemical, or mechanical stress to perturb the folding equilibrium for examining protein stability and the protein folding process. Elucidation of the mechanism by which chemical denaturants unfold proteins is crucial; this study explores the nature of urea-aromatic interactions relevant in urea-assisted protein denaturation. Free energy profiles corresponding to the unfolding of Trp-cage miniprotein in the presence and absence of urea at three different temperatures demonstrate the distortion of the hydrophobic core to be a crucial step. Exposure of the Trp6 residue to the solvent is found to be favored in the presence of urea. Previous experiments showed that urea has a high affinity for aromatic groups of proteins. We show here that this is due to the remarkable ability of urea to form stacking and NH-$\pi$ interactions with aromatic groups of proteins. Urea-nucleobase stacking interactions have been shown to be crucial in urea-assisted RNA unfolding. Examination of these interactions using microsecond-long unrestrained simulations shows that urea-aromatic stacking interactions are stabilizing and long lasting. Further MD simulations, thermodynamic integration, and quantum mechanical calculations on aromatic model systems reveal that such interactions are possible for all the aromatic amino acid side-chains. Finally, we validate the ubiquitous nature of urea-aromatic stacking interactions by analyzing experimental structures of urea transporters and proteins crystallized in the presence of urea or urea derivatives.},

abstract = {Gabedit is a freeware graphical user interface, offering preprocessing and postprocessing adapted (to date) to nine computational chemistry software packages. It includes tools for editing, displaying, analyzing, convert- ing, and animating molecular systems. A conformational search tool is implemented using a molecular mechanics or a semiempirical potential. Input files can be generated for the computational chemistry software supported by Gabe- dit. Some molecular properties of interest are processed directly from the output of the computational chemistry pro- grams; others are calculated by Gabedit before display. Molecular orbitals, electron density, electrostatic potential, nuclear magnetic resonance shielding density, and any other volumetric data properties can be displayed. It can dis- play electronic circular dichroism, UV–visible, infrared, and Raman-computed spectra after a convolution. Gabedit can generate a Povray file for geometry, surfaces, contours, and color-coded planes. Output can be exported to a selection of popular image and vector graphics file formats; the program can also generate a series of pictures for animation. Quantum mechanical electrostatic potentials can be calculated using the partial charges on atoms, or by solving the Poisson equation using the multigrid method. The atoms in molecule charges can also be calculated. Gabedit is platform independent. The code is distributed under free open source X11 style license and is available at http://gabedit.sourceforge.net/.},

abstract = {Exciton diffusion is a critical step for energy conversion in optoelectronic devices. This spawns the desire for theoretical approaches that allow for fast but reliable determinations of the material-dependent exciton transport parameters. For this purpose, the Marcus theory, which is widely used in the context of charge transport, is adapted to exciton diffusion. In contrast to the common approach of calculating the exciton hopping rate via the coupling and the spectral overlap, this alternative approach is less costly, because, instead of the spectral overlap, only the reorganization energy is needed. To demonstrate the capability of the approach, the diffusion constants for naphthalene, anthracene, and diindenoperylene crystals are calculated and compared with both calculations conducted with the well-established exciton hopping rate, including coupling and spectral overlap, and with experimental data. These test calculations show that Marcus-based exciton diffusion properties tend to be too small but are qualitatively correct (i.e., they seem to be useful to predict trends). Nevertheless, for reliable results, high-level quantum chemical approaches are necessary for the computation of the reorganization energies. However, they have to be calculated only once. Coupling constants, which are needed for all pairs of monomers, have a considerably smaller influence, i.e., they can be computed by a lower level approach, which makes the method even less costly. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Though it may not seem this way for those who have been in the field for most of their careers, in the overall scheme of professions, software builders are relative newbies. In the short history of the software field, a lot of facts have been identified, and a lot of fallacies promulgated. Those facts and fallacies are what this book is about. There's a problem with those factsand, as you might imagine, those fallacies. Many of these fundamentally important facts are learned by a software engineer, but over the short lifespan of the software field, all too many of them have been forgotten. While reading Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering, you may experience moments of Oh, yes, I had forgotten that, alongside some Is that really true? thoughts. The author of this book doesn't shy away from controversy. In fact, each of the facts and fallacies is accompanied by a discussion of whatever controversy envelops it. You may find yourself agreeing with a lot of the facts and fallacies, yet emotionally disturbed by a few of them!

Here we coarse-grain atomistic position data from polyethylene (PE) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) melt simulations by combining $\lambda$ backbone carbon atoms in a single CG bead. Resulting CG variables have correlations along the chain backbone that depend on the coarse-graining scale $\lambda$ and are generally not reproduced by independent bond-length, bond-angle and torsion-angle distributions. By constructing distributions of CG variables equivalent to those from simulated CG potentials we are able to evaluate the bond-orientation correlation for different CG models at reduced computational cost. CG models and potentials that include only nonbonded, bond-length, and bond-angle interactions computed by Boltzmann inversion correctly reproduce the CG variable distributions but do not necessarily reproduce the chain stiffness, overestimating the persistence length Lp and end-to-end distance 〈R2〉1/2 with increasing $\lambda$. While CG models that include an independent torsion angle match the bond-orientation correlation and 〈R2〉1/2 better, only approximate models that include correlations between bond and torsion angles match the true bond-orientation correlation.},

Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij → 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons.

abstract = {UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. RESULTS: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. CONCLUSIONS: Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

abstract = {A geometrical analysis has been performed on JT-TT stacking in metal complexes with aromatic nitrogen-containing ligands based on a Cambridge Structural Database search and on X-ray data of examples in the recent literature. It is evident that a face-to-face n-n alignment where most of the ring-plane area overlaps is a rare phenomenon. The usual n interaction is an offset or slipped stacking, i.e. the rings are parallel displaced. The ring normal and the vector between the ring centroids form an angle of about 20° up to centroid-centroid distances of 3.8 A. Such a paralleldisplaced structure also has a contribution from JT-CT attraction, the more so with increasing offset. Only a limited number of structures with a near to perfect facial alignment exists. The term n-7t stacking is occasionally used even when there is no substantial overlap of the it-ring planes. There is a number of metal-ligand complexes where only the edges of the rings interact in what would be better described a C-H ju attraction. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2000.},

abstract = {We have surveyed proteins with known atomic structure whose function involves electron transfer; in these, electrons can travel up to 14 {\AA} between redox centres through the protein medium. Transfer over longer distances always involves a chain of cofactors. This redox centre proximity alone is sufficient to allow tunnelling of electrons at rates far faster than the substrate redox reactions it supports. Consequently, there has been no necessity for proteins to evolve optimized routes between redox centres. Instead, simple geometry enables rapid tunnelling to high-energy intermediate states. This greatly simplifies any analysis of redox protein mechanisms and challenges the need to postulate mechanisms of superexchange through redox centres or the maintenance of charge neutrality when investigating electron- transfer reactions. Such tunnelling also allows sequential electron transfer in catalytic sites to surmount radical transition states without involving the movement of hydride ions, as is generally assumed. The 14 {\AA} or less spacing of redox centres provides highly robust engineering for electron transfer, and may reflect selection against designs that have proved more vulnerable to mutations during the course of evolution.},

abstract = {Biological electron transfer is designed to connect catalytic clusters by chains of redox cofactors. A review of the characterized natural redox proteins with a critical eye for molecular scale measurement of variation and selection related to physiological function shows no statistically significant differences in the protein medium lying between cofactors engaged in physiologically beneficial or detrimental electron transfer. Instead, control of electron tunnelling over long distances relies overwhelmingly on less than 14 {\AA} spacing between the cofactors in a chain. Near catalytic clusters, shorter distances (commonly less than 7 {\AA}) appear to be selected to generate tunnelling frequencies sufficiently high to scale the barriers of multi-electron, bond-forming/-breaking catalysis at physiological rates. We illustrate this behaviour in a tunnelling network analysis of cytochrome c oxidase. In order to surmount the large, thermally activated, adiabatic barriers in the 5-10 kcal mol-1 range expected for H+ motion and O2 reduction at the binuclear centre of oxidase on the 10 3-105 s-1 time-scale of respiration, electron access with a tunnelling frequency of 109 or 1010 s -1 is required. This is provided by selecting closely placed redox centres, such as haem a (6.9 {\AA}) or tyrosine (4.9 {\AA}). A corollary is that more distantly placed redox centres, such as CuA, cannot rapidly scale the catalytic site barrier, but must send their electrons through more closely placed centres, avoiding direct short circuits that might circumvent proton pumping coupled to haems a to a3 electron transfer. The selection of distances and energetic barriers directs electron transfer from CuA to haem a rather than a3, without any need for delicate engineering of the protein medium to 'hard wire' electron transfer. Indeed, an examination of a large number of oxidoreductases provides no evidence of such naturally selected wiring of electron tunnelling pathways. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

Contemporary molecular simulation software such as AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, and SOMD include support for the method. Implementation details vary among those codes, but users expect reliability and reproducibility, i.e., for a given molecular model and set of force field parameters, comparable free energy differences should be obtained within statistical bounds regardless of the code used. Relative alchemical free energy (RAFE) simulation is increasingly used to support molecule discovery projects, yet the reproducibility of the methodology has been less well tested than its absolute counterpart. Here we present RAFE calculations of hydration free energies for a set of small organic molecules and demonstrate that free energies can be reproduced to within about 0.2 kcal/mol with the aforementioned codes. Absolute alchemical free energy simulations have been carried out as a reference. Achieving this level of reproducibility requires considerable attention to detail and package-specific simulation protocols, and no universally applicable protocol emerges. The benchmarks and protocols reported here should be useful for the community to validate new and future versions of software for free energy calculations.},

The force fields incorporate the results of ab initio calculations of the bond torsion energies of selected oligomers and differ in the set of atomic charges used to represent the electrostatic interactions. We then present the results of an extensive validation of these force fields, by means of molecular mechanics (MM) energy minimizations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the crystal structures of these oligomers and polymers. While our "best" force field does not outperform the others on each of the investigated systems, it provides a balanced description of their overall structure and energetics. Finally, our MM minimizations and MD simulations confirm that the reported crystal structures of P3MBT and P3BT are stable and correspond to well-defined energetic minima. The room-temperature MD simulations reveal a certain degree of side-chain disorder, even in our virtually defect-free polymer crystal models.},

abstract = {The outstanding challenges in computer simulations of biological macromolecules are related to their complexity. Part of the complexity of biological systems concerns their physical size. Enumerating atoms ranging from a few in small signal molecules to the millions of particles in biological complexes is an obvious example of biological hierarchy. Another aspect is the extremely broad range of timescales of life science processes (many orders of magnitude); this adds another dimension of complexity. This extended range of timescales may even be observed for a single biomolecular process. Consider, for example, the R to T transition in hemoglobin. The complete conformational change occurs in tens of microseconds. However, the system has more than one timescale. Considerable activity occurs on a range of timescales before the final event (heme relaxation, picoseconds; tertiary relaxation, nanoseconds; ligand escape from the protein matrix and rebinding, hundreds of nanoseconds and so on). Whereas the basic time-step of atomically detailed simulations is about a femtosecond, it is not difficult to find molecular processes in biology that span more than ten orders of magnitude of relevant times, making the straightforward simulation of these events very difficult. Several techniques have been developed in recent years to address these problems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article reviews the basic computational techniques for carrying out multi-scale simulations using statistical methods, with the focus on simulations of epitaxial growth. First, the statistical-physics background behind Monte Carlo simulations is briefly described. The kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method is introduced as an extension of the more wide-spread thermodynamic Monte Carlo methods, and algorithms for kMC simulations, including parallel ones, are discussed in some detail. The step from the atomistic picture to the more coarse-grained description of Monte Carlo simulations is exemplified for the case of surface diffusion. Here, the aim is the derivation of rate constants from knowledge about the underlying atomic processes. Both the simple approach of Transition State Theory, as well as more recent approaches using accelerated molecular dynamics are reviewed. Finally, I address the point that simplifications often need to be introduced in practical Monte Carlo simulations in order to reduce the complexity of 'real' atomic processes. Different 'flavors' of kMC simulations and the potential pitfalls related to the reduction of complexity are presented in the context of simulations of epitaxial growth.},

abstract = {Thermodynamic properties are often modeled by classical force fields which describe the interactions on the atomistic scale. Molecular simulations are used for retrieving thermodynamic data from such models, and many simulation techniques and computer codes are available for that purpose. In the present round robin study, the following fundamental question is addressed: Will different user groups working with different simulation codes obtain coinciding results within the statistical uncertainty of their data? A set of 24 simple simulation tasks is defined and solved by five user groups working with eight molecular simulation codes: DL-POLY, GROMACS, IMC, LAMMPS, ms2, NAMD, Tinker, and TOWHEE. Each task consists of the definition of (1) a pure fluid that is described by a force field and (2) the conditions under which that property is to be determined. The fluids are four simple alkanes: ethane, propane, n-butane, and iso-butane. All force fields consider internal degrees of freedom: OPLS, TraPPE, and a modified OPLS version with bond stretching vibrations. Density and potential energy are determined as a function of temperature and pressure on a grid which is specified such that all states are liquid. The user groups worked independently and reported their results to a central instance. The full set of results was disclosed to all user groups only at the end of the study. During the study, the central instance gave only qualitative feedback. The results reveal the challenges of carrying out molecular simulations. Several iterations were needed to eliminate gross errors. For most simulation tasks, the remaining deviations between the results of the different groups are acceptable from a practical standpoint, but they are often outside of the statistical errors of the individual simulation data. However, there are also cases where the deviations are unacceptable. This study highlights similarities between computer experiments and laboratory experiments, which are both subject not only to statistical error but also to systematic error.},

Results show that charge separation is an energetically favorable process for about 50{\%} of interfacial e-h pairs, which provides a rationale for the high internal quantum efficiencies reported for P3HT/PCBM heterojunctions.

abstract = {Motivated by the need to establish a multiscale understanding of the mechanical and thermal properties of polymers used for nano-, meso- and macro-composites, we are presenting an investigation of the cross-linking process (associated with curing) of an epoxy phenol novolac and bisphenol-A melt system via coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, we are focusing on the associated structural and physical behaviors of the melts of different cross-linking degree under Couette and Poiseuille flow conditions. At the nanoscale, we also investigated the stress, heat flux and temperature fields that are computable from the quantities of the coarse-grained model of the epoxy resin melt with the extended Hardy's theory to multibody potentials. We have established that the epoxy resin chains tend to reorient along the direction of the imposed Couette flow, and the degree of alignment increases with the cross-linking degree and shear rate. The pronounced reorientation of cross-linked epoxy resin melts can be ascribed to the inter-bonded chains. This conformational change explains the shear thinning behaviors of cross-linked melts that initiate at low shear rates. The cross-linked melts under Poiseuille flow possess less pronounced velocity profiles, accompanied with the smaller temperature rise from the applied gravity force. Due to the size of the nanoscale channel height, the epoxy resin melts under Poiseuille flow can only be approximately predicted via the continuum theory. We have shown that the discrepancies between atomistic simulations and continuum predictions increase as the wall/epoxy interaction strength reduces. This study reveals the variations of important rheological properties during the cross-linking process and elucidates the roles played by the topological changes in the shear flow, thus can contribute to the design and manufacturing of the epoxy-resin based nanocomposites.

abstract = {Photosynthetic complexes are exquisitely tuned to capture solar light efficiently, and then transmit the excitation energy to reaction centres, where long term energy storage is initiated. The energy transfer mechanism is often described by semiclassical models that invoke 'hopping' of excited-state populations along discrete energy levels. Two-dimensional Fourier transform electronic spectroscopy has mapped these energy levels and their coupling in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) bacteriochlorophyll complex, which is found in green sulphur bacteria and acts as an energy 'wire' connecting a large peripheral light-harvesting antenna, the chlorosome, to the reaction centre. The spectroscopic data clearly document the dependence of the dominant energy transport pathways on the spatial properties of the excited-state wavefunctions of the whole bacteriochlorophyll complex. But the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence, which has no classical analogue, was largely neglected in the analyses - even though electronic energy transfer involving oscillatory populations of donors and acceptors was first discussed more than 70 years ago, and electronic quantum beats arising from quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes have been predicted and indirectly observed. Here we extend previous two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy investigations of the FMO bacteriochlorophyll complex, and obtain direct evidence for remarkably long-lived electronic quantum coherence playing an important part in energy transfer processes within this system. The quantum coherence manifests itself in characteristic, directly observable quantum beating signals among the excitons within the Chlorobium tepidum FMO complex at 77 K. This wavelike characteristic of the energy transfer within the photosynthetic complex can explain its extreme efficiency, in that it allows the complexes to sample vast areas of phase space to find the most efficient path. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Analysis of aqueous dye spectra yielded similar standard free energies of dimerization ($\Delta$G° {\~{}} -6.5 kcal/mol) for related anionic and cationic thiacarbocyanines (ThC). The spectral characteristics of the intermolecular aqueous dimers resembled those of covalently bonded bis-ThC dyes in organic solvents. In water, these bis-dyes yielded blue-shifted bands which culminated in an intense, narrow and nonfluorescent hypsochromic transition (H*) which was assigned to a 3-dimensional colloidal aggregate. Depending on its 9-substituent, 5,5' -dichloro ThC formed dimers and either the previously described H-aggregates or a red-shifted J-aggregate which could be separated from other dye species by centrifugation. This process was reversible for a benzimidazolocarbocyanine (BiC) which in aqueous solution existed solely as a monomer and a single J-aggregate; the latter was shown to be a tetramer ($\Delta$G° = -22.4 kcal/per mole of tetramer). Dissociation of this J-aggregate and of 2,2'-carbocyanine dimers to monomeric dye was examined as a function of the concentration and structure of additives which included methanol, urea, acetone, phenol, a tetraazaindene and C12-micellar surfactants; their deaggregation activity increased in the given sequence. These effects on monomer/polymer equilibria of dye ions were discussed in terms of various bond types. With differently substituted and charged BiC derivatives and vinylogs, the transition energies of monomeric dye in water solution (Ms) and of J-aggregates adsorbed on aqueous AgBr [111] dispersions (Ja) were related by the expression Ja = Ms - 6.0 kcal/mol. Hence, for these J-aggregates, no need existed for invoking specific relations between size of the dye and spacing of particular sites at the AgBr lattice. },

Diarylureas with meta-substituted electron-withdrawing groups on the aryl rings are capable of forming cocrystal complexes with a wide variety of hydrogen bond acceptors. One particular DAU, 1,3-bis(m-nitrophenyl)urea, behaves primarily as a proton donor, one of the few organic molecules known to have this property. Its hydrogen bond accepting ability is drastically reduced, possibly because of two very weak CH{\ldots}O interactions occurring in response to the presence of guest acceptor molecules and effectively negating the powerful proton-accepting ability of the urea carbonyl group. Only DAU compounds with meta-substituted electron-withdrawing groups have this property. The crystal structures of four DAU compounds and six of their cocrystal structures are reported. In addition, 19 other DAU cocrystals were prepared and characterized by chemical and spectroscopic means, and their hydrogen bond patterns were assigned based on spectroscopic analogies to those with known crystal structures. From this data hydrogen bond rules for diarylureas have been derived for use in predicting hydrogen bond patterns in related structures. {\textcopyright} 1990, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more “representations,” in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

abstract = {Photosynthesis begins with light harvesting, where specialized pigment-protein complexes transform sunlight into electronic excitations delivered to reaction centres to initiate charge separation. There is evidence that quantum coherence between electronic excited states plays a role in energy transfer. In this review, we discuss how quantum coherence manifests in photosynthetic light harvesting and its implications. We begin by examining the concept of an exciton, an excited electronic state delocalized over several spatially separated molecules, which is the most widely available signature of quantum coherence in light harvesting.We then discuss recent results concerning the possibility that quantum coherence between electronically excited states of donors and acceptors may give rise to a quantum coherent evolution of excitations, modifying the traditional incoherent picture of energy transfer.Key to this (partially) coherent energy transfer appears to be the structure of the environment, in particular the participation of non-equilibrium vibrational modes. We discuss the open questions and controversies regarding quantum coherent energy transfer and how these can be addressed using new experimental techniques. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {Photosynthesis makes use of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into useful biomass and is vital for life on Earth. Crucial components for the photosynthetic process are antenna proteins, which absorb light and transmit the resultant excitation energy between molecules to a reaction centre. The efficiency of these electronic energy transfers has inspired much work on antenna proteins isolated from photosynthetic organisms to uncover the basic mechanisms at play. Intriguingly, recent work has documented that light-absorbing molecules in some photosynthetic proteins capture and transfer energy according to quantum-mechanical probability laws instead of classical laws at temperatures up to 180 K. This contrasts with the long-held view that long-range quantum coherence between molecules cannot be sustained in complex biological systems, even at low temperatures. Here we present two-dimensional photon echo spectroscopy measurements on two evolutionarily related light-harvesting proteins isolated from marine cryptophyte algae, which reveal exceptionally long-lasting excitation oscillations with distinct correlations and anti-correlations even at ambient temperature. These observations provide compelling evidence for quantum-coherent sharing of electronic excitation across the 5-nm-wide proteins under biologically relevant conditions, suggesting that distant molecules within the photosynthetic proteins are 'wired' together by quantum coherence for more efficient light-harvesting in cryptophyte marine algae. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The increasing interest in the modeling of complex macromolecular systems in recent years has spurred the development of numerous coarse-graining (CG) techniques. However, many of the CG models are constructed assuming that all details beneath the resolution of CG degrees of freedom are fast and average out, which sets limits on the resolution of feasible coarse-grainings and on the range of applications of the CG models. Ultra-coarse-graining (UCG) makes it possible to construct models at any desired resolution while accounting for discrete conformational or chemical changes within the CG sites that can modulate the interactions between them. Here, we discuss the UCG methodology and its numerical implementation. We pay particular attention to the numerical mechanism for including state transitions between different conformations within CG sites because this has not been discussed previously. Using a simple example of 1,2-dichloroethane, we demonstrate the ability of the UCG model to reproduce the multiconfigurational behavior of this molecular liquid, even when each molecule is modeled with only one CG site. The methodology can also be applied to other molecular liquids and macromolecular systems with time scale separation between conformational transitions and other intramolecular motions and rotations.},

@article{Fothergill2021,
abstract = {Crystal engineering relies on the predictability of the elaborate interplay of cohesive and conformational energies driven by both intra- and intermolecular interactions of the constituent molecules. In an effort to better understand these influences on the crystal packing of para-substituted N,N′-diphenylureas (pDPUs) and organometallic derivatives, we present a detailed computational investigation of pDPU species utilizing solid-state density functional theory (DFT) and demonstrate the applicability of predictive supramolecular synthons applied toward the growth of related organometallic complexes. Dominant noncovalent interactions of pDPUs can be tuned by altering the electron-withdrawing character of the para substituents. The strength of this electron-withdrawing nature governs the inclination of the molecules to form either dominant electrostatic or $\pi$-stacking intermolecular interactions in the crystal structure due to potential molecular conformational stabilization through intramolecular C-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}O electrostatic interactions between ortho phenyl hydrogens and the urea oxygen atoms. This propensity is also influenced by the symmetry of para substitutions in mono- and disubstituted DPUs. The results of the holistic DFT investigation show a relationship between gas-phase and solid-state conformations and also present evidence of mechanisms leading to deviations in predicted crystallization behaviors on the basis of the balance of intra- and intermolecular interactions. The foundational computational study was expanded to build on previous experimental and theoretical work involving zerovalent transition-metal complexes in which p-isocyanophenyl DPUs were appended with group IV metal carbonyl fragments. In this study, we synthesized an asymmetric analogue of the latter in which N-(p-isocyanophenyl)-N′-phenylurea (pCNHDPU) was appended to a Mo(CO)5 metal carbonyl fragment, allowing us to associate the crystallization behaviors and interactions of organometallic DPU derivatives with those of simpler pDPUs. It was observed that the supramolecular assembly of the organometallic complexes display similar predictive patterns as well as additional complexities to molecular packing arising from the bulkier metal carbonyl substituents. An inclusive computational categorization of DPU-based systems in complement to experimental data will aid in the advancement of design rules for the patterned crystal growth of DPU and related systems for the development of innovative materials having unique solid-state properties.},

New United Atom types are proposed to handle the ternary and quaternary carbons involved in naphthenes and aromatics bearing alkyl groups or naphthenoaromatics, and published TraPPE-UA parameters are kept unchanged for other groups. The extended forcefield is tested for accuracy and internal consistency on a set of 34 compounds comprising between 5 and 28 carbon atoms including naphthenic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, naphthenoaromatics, and thiophenic compounds. This set of compounds contains several multi-functional polycyclic molecules which can now be described with the forcefield extensions provided by this work (e.g. 5$\alpha$ cholestane, 1-hexyl tetralin) and that are representative of a much wider range of compounds for which predictions through theoretical methods are difficult to be achieved. Comparison with available experimental data on normal boiling temperature, vapor pressure, and liquid density, reveals average absolute deviations of 6.4 K on normal boiling temperature and 0.91{\%} on standard liquid density, without noticeable increase of deviations with molecular weight.

abstract = {Deficiencies in engineering education have been exhaustively enumerated in recent years. Engineering schools and professors have been told by countless panels and blue-ribbon commissions and, in the United States, by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology that we must strengthen our coverage of fundamentals; teach more about " real-world " engineering design and operations, including quality management; cover more material in frontier areas of engineering; offer more and better instruction in both oral and written communication skills and teamwork skills; provide training in critical and creative thinking skills and problem-solving methods; produce graduates who are conversant with engineering ethics and the connections between technology and society; and reduce the number of hours in the engineering curriculum so that the average student can complete it in four years. 1 This is an impressive wish list—especially when the last item is included—that cannot possibly be fulfilled using the approach to educating engineers that has predominated in the past 50 years. If, for example, courses continue to be confined to single subjects (heat transfer in one course, thermodynamics in another, environmental engineering in another, technical writing in another, etc.) it will take a six-or seven-year curriculum to produce engineers who have the desired proficiency in the fundamentals and are conversant with methods of modern engineering practice, culturally literate, and skilled in communication. Moreover, if students are assigned only well-defined convergent problems, they will never gain the skills needed to tackle and solve challenging multidisciplinary problems that call for critical judgment and creativity. Finally, even if nothing new is added to the existing curriculum, confining it to four years will be almost impossible unless more efficient and effective ways to cover the material can be found. The reality is that better teaching methods exist. The literature in general education, technical education, and educational psychology is replete with methods that have been shown to facilitate learning more effectively than the traditional single-discipline lecturing approach. Unfortunately, these developments have so far had relatively little impact on mainstream engineering education. Although their content has changed in some ways and the students use calculators and computers instead of slide rules, many engineering classes in 1999 are taught in exactly the same way that engineering classes in 1959 were taught.},

The features of the donor-acceptor morphology (e.g., domain shapes, crystalline/amorphous domains, and donor-acceptor interface) can in principle be tuned by choosing the chemistry and architecture of the conjugated polymer, fullerene functional group, solvents, and processing conditions (e.g., annealing temperature). Here, we present a high-throughput coarse-grained simulation study that links molecular-level design parameters to features in the assembled morphology in neat polymers and donor-acceptor blends. These models reproduce neat polymer morphologies observed in experiments, such as lamellae, hexagonally packed cylinders, and acceptor intercalation among donor side chains. Furthermore, for blends of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives, this study shows how conjugated polymer architecture and acceptor miscibility can be tailored to obtain new blend morphologies, which have features that are known to be optimal for higher efficiency solar cells. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Ponder2003,
abstract = {The chapter focuses on a general description of the force fields that are most commonly used at present, and it gives an indication of the directions of current research that may yield better functions in the near future. After a brief survey of current models, mostly generated during the 1990s, the focus of the chapter is on the general directions the field is taking in developing new models. The most commonly used protein force fields incorporate a relatively simple potential energy function: The emphasis is on the use of continuum methods to model the electrostatic effects of hydration and the introduction of polarizability to model the electronic response to changes in the environment. Some of the history and performance of widely used protein force fields based on an equation on simplest potential energy function or closely related equations are reviewed. The chapter outlines some promising developments that go beyond this, primarily by altering the way electrostatic interactions are treated. The use of atomic multipoles and off-center charge distributions, as well as attempts to incorporate electronic polarizability, are also discussed in the chapter.},

Drawing on literature from personnel economics, we lay out how coders' skill level affects their selection for a focal project in the first place. In turn, we theorize how project-specific norms and quality aspirations that developers learn about after joining an OSS project represent treatments that varyingly entice developers to contribute more code conditional on their skill level. Based on a custom-tailored dataset merging GitHub and Stack Overflow data for almost 50,000 contributor-project-month observations, we find that repository owners are able to motivate their most talented volunteer contributors when they (1) show no visible commercial orientation while managing their projects, (2) show generosity in accepting external contributions, and (3) provide fast feedback. We discuss implications for research and practice in the fields of community-based organizations like OSS as well as personnel economics.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, High-Performance Computing (HPC) communities have developed many models for delivering education aiming to help students understand and harness the power of parallel and distributed computing. Most of these courses either lack a hands-on component or heavily focus on theoretical characterization behind complex algorithms. To bridge the gap between application and scientific theory, NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) (nvidia.com/dli) has designed an on-line education and training platform that helps students, developers, and engineers solve real-world problems in a wide range of domains using deep learning and accelerated computing. DLI's accelerated computing course content starts with the fundamentals of accelerating applications with CUDA and OpenACC in addition to other courses in training and deploying neural networks for deep learning. Advanced and domain-specific courses in deep learning are also available. The online platform enables students to use the latest AI frameworks, SDKs, and GPU-accelerated technologies on fully-configured GPU servers in the cloud so the focus is more on learning and less on environment setup. Students are offered project-based assessment and certification at the end of some courses. To support academics and university researchers teaching accelerated computing and deep learning, the DLI University Ambassador Program enables educators to teach free DLI courses to university students, faculty, and researchers.},

@article{Isaacson2009,
abstract = {The increasing production and use of fullerene nanomaterials has led to calls for more information regarding the potential impacts that releases of these materials may have on human and environmental health. Fullerene nanomaterials, which are comprised of both fullerenes and surface-functionalized fullerenes, are used in electronic, optic, medical and cosmetic applications. Measuring fullerene nanomaterial concentrations in natural environments is difficult because they exhibit a duality of physical and chemical characteristics as they transition from hydrophobic to polar forms upon exposure to water. In aqueous environments, this is expressed as their tendency to initially (i) self assemble into aggregates of appreciable size and hydrophobicity, and subsequently (ii) interact with the surrounding water molecules and other chemical constituents in natural environments thereby acquiring negative surface charge. Fullerene nanomaterials may therefore deceive the application of any single analytical method that is applied with the assumption that fullerenes have but one defining characteristic (e.g., hydrophobicity). [1] We find that analytical procedures are needed to account for the potentially transitory nature of fullerenes in natural environments through the use of approaches that provide chemically-explicit information including molecular weight and the number and identity of surface functional groups. [2] We suggest that sensitive and mass-selective detection, such as that offered by mass spectrometry when combined with optimized extraction procedures, offers the greatest potential to achieve this goal. [3] With this review, we show that significant improvements in analytical rigor would result from an increased availability of well characterized authentic standards, reference materials, and isotopically-labeled internal standards. Finally, the benefits of quantitative and validated analytical methods for advancing the knowledge on fullerene occurrence, fate, and behavior are indicated.},

The maximum in-plane electrical conductivity of doped films is observed at a molar doping fraction of 0.17, in agreement with the binding mechanism of F4TCNQ:P3HT complexes. Through the use of X-ray diffraction, a previously unreported crystalline phase is observed for P3HT films doped above a critical threshold concentration. This crystalline phase involves the incorporation of F4TCNQ molecules into ordered polymer regions and ultimately improves charge dissociation, leading to higher carrier density in thin film. Finally, optical absorption and X-ray diffraction reveal that the chemical state of P3HT in solution has a dramatic impact on the electrical and structural properties of the blended films.{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Weather and climate science has undergone a computational revolution in recent decades, to the point where all modern research relies heavily on software and code. Despite this profound change in the research methods employed by weather and climate scientists, the reporting of computational results has changed very little in relevant academic journals. This lag has led to something of a reproducibility crisis, whereby it is impossible to replicate and verify most of today's published computational results. While it is tempting to simply decry the slow response of journals and funding agencies in the face of this crisis, there are very few examples of reproducible weather and climate research upon which to base new communication standards. In an attempt to address this deficiency, this essay describes a procedure for reporting computational results that was employed in a recent Journal of Climate paper. The procedure was developed to be consistent with recommended computational best practices and seeks to minimize the time burden on authors, which has been identified as the most important barrier to publishing code. It should provide a starting point for weather and climate scientists looking to publish reproducible research, and it is proposed that journals could adopt the procedure as a minimum standard.},

@article{Dama2017,
abstract = {When viewed through a coarse-grained lens, important molecular and biophysical systems can appear to undergo discrete, switch-like state changes in addition to more continuous configurational motions. One of our recent papers described a theory for bottom-up coarse-graining of the equilibrium statistics of models with such behavior, called ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) models, and a follow up paper described an implementation when the states of the coarse- grained sites or “beads” change rarely. However, not all systems with this discrete behavior fall under that special limit. This article develops the general UCG theory for the opposite limit, that is, where the internal states of the CG particles or beads adjust rapidly so as to always remain effectively at quasi- equilibrium no matter what the positions of the coarse-grained particles. This rapid local equilibrium allows ultra-coarse-graining to mix standard coarse-grained force fields by using local order parameters to control the degree of mixing, which adds an environmental dependence and many-body effects to the coarse-grained model while requiring minimal new coding. This article first presents the definition of such UCG force fields as well as their fitting procedures from atomistic-scale data, and then it presents three examples of UCG simulations with an approach that we call UCG with rapid local equilibrium (UCG-RLE). We then present an application of UCG-RLE using the full bottom-up methodology to coarse-grain and simulate cooperative hydrophobic association of neopentane in methanol solvent. UCG-RLE force matching does a superior job of matching solute− solute correlation functions and solute cluster size distributions compared to the more standard force-matched models not having coarse-grained sites with discrete internal states.},

abstract = {Background The structure and dynamics of DNA are critically related to its function. Molecular dynamics simulations augment experiment by providing detailed information about the atomic motions. However, to date the simulations have not been long enough for convergence of the dynamics and structural properties of DNA. Methods Molecular dynamics simulations performed with AMBER using the ff99SB force field with the parmbsc0 modifications, including ensembles of independent simulations, were compared to long timescale molecular dynamics performed with the specialized Anton MD engine on the B-DNA structure d(GCACGAACGAACGAACGC). To assess convergence, the decay of the average RMSD values over longer and longer time intervals was evaluated in addition to assessing convergence of the dynamics via the Kullback-Leibler divergence of principal component projection histograms. Results These molecular dynamics simulations - including one of the longest simulations of DNA published to date at {\~{}} 44 $\mu$s - surprisingly suggest that the structure and dynamics of the DNA helix, neglecting the terminal base pairs, are essentially fully converged on the {\~{}} 1-5 $\mu$s timescale. Conclusions We can now reproducibly converge the structure and dynamics of B-DNA helices, omitting the terminal base pairs, on the $\mu$s time scale with both the AMBER and CHARMM C36 nucleic acid force fields. Results from independent ensembles of simulations starting from different initial conditions, when aggregated, match the results from long timescale simulations on the specialized Anton MD engine. General significance With access to large-scale GPU resources or the specialized MD engine "Anton" it is possible for a variety of molecular systems to reproducibly and reliably converge the conformational ensemble of sampled structures.

Amyloids can also have normal biological functions and, in the future, could be used as the basis for novel nanoscale materials. However, a full understanding of the physicochemical forces that drive protein aggregation is still lacking. Such understanding is crucial for the development of drugs that can effectively inhibit aberrant amyloid aggregation and for the directed design of functional amyloids. Atomistic simulations can help understand protein aggregation. In particular, atomistic simulations can be used to study the initial formation of toxic oligomers which are hard to characterize experimentally, and to understand the difference in aggregation behaviour between different amyloidogenic peptides. Here, we review the latest atomistic simulations of protein aggregation, concentrating on amyloidogenic protein fragments, and provide an outlook for the future in this field.},

abstract = {Coarse-grain potentials allow one to extend molecular simulations to length and time scales beyond those accesssible to atomistic representations of the interacting system. Since the coarse-grain potentials remove a large number of interaction sites and, hence, a large number of degrees of freedom, it is generally assumed that coarse-grain potentials are not transferable to different systems or state points (temperature and pressure). Here we apply lessons learned from the parametrization of transferable atomistic potentials to develop a systematic procedure for the parametrization of transferable coarse-grain potentials. In particular, we apply an iterative Boltzmann optimization for the determination of the bonded interactions for coarse-grain beads belonging to the same molecule and separated by one or two coarse-grain bonds and parametrize the nonbonded interactions by fitting to the vapor-liquid coexistence curves computed for selected molecules represented by the TraPPE-UA (transferable potentials for phase equilibria-united atom) force field. This approach is tested here for linear alkanes where parameters for C(3)H(7) end segments and for C(3)H(6) middle segments of the TraPPE-CG (transferable potentials for phase equilibria-coarse grain) force field are determined and it is shown that these parameters yield quite accurate vapor-liquid equilibria for neat n-hexane to n-triacontane and for the binary mixture of n-hexane and n-hexatriacontane. In addition, the position of the first peak in various radial distribution functions and the coordination number for the first solvation shell are well reproduced by the TraPPE-CG force field, but the first peaks are too high and narrow.},

abstract = {We present a new estimator for computing free energy differences and thermodynamic expectations as well as their uncertainties from samples obtained from multiple equilibrium states via either simulation or experiment. The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Its broad coverage, concise explanations, and robust mathematical support are clearly presented in an engaging style to furnish students with a solid foundation in the subject. In this ninth edition the authors continue to refine their presentation of physical chemistry. The coverage of introductory topics is streamlined, and the addition of a new fundamentals chapter provides students with an overview of key principles on which the subject is based. The text includes increased coverage of computational chemistry and additional contextual examples of materials chemistry throughout, mirroring the current needs of today's students and lecturers. Mathematics remains an intrinsic yet challenging part of physical chemistry. Extensive mathematical support, including a 'Checklist of key equations' at the end of every chapter, and 'Mathematical background' sections containing worked examples and self-tests, empower students to overcome any barriers to understanding that grasping the mathematical content might present. These features help to ensure the reader can master the subject without a need to sacrifice the rigour and depth of the mathematical content. The pedagogical framework, which is a hallmark of the authors' writing, has been further strengthened. New 'Key points' provide summaries of the main take-home messages of each section and enable students to gain an overview of the topic before tackling it in depth; 'Brief illustrations' give a concise insight into how a particular mathematical concept is applied in practice, providing students with the opportunity to contextualise their learning. All these exciting new features and innovations are presented within a refreshed full colour text design, to stimulate and engage students yet further. The Online Resource Centre contains Living Graphs, illustrations from the book, and web links. An Instructor's Solutions Manual (free to adopters) and a Student's Solutions Manual are also available.

Supramolecular chemistry has expanded dramatically in recent years both in terms of potential applications and in its relevance to analogous biological systems. The formation and function of supramolecular complexes occur through a multiplicity of often difficult to differentiate noncovalent forces. The aim of this Review is to describe the crucial interaction mechanisms in context, and thus classify the entire subject. In most cases, organic host–guest complexes have been selected as examples, but biologically relevant problems are also considered. An understanding and quantification of intermolecular interactions is of importance both for the rational planning of new supramolecular systems, including intelligent materials, as well as for developing new biologically active agents.

abstract = {Many areas of research suffer from poor reproducibility, particularly in computationally intensive domains where results rely on a series of complex methodological decisions that are not well captured by traditional publication approaches. Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility, but implementation of these practices remains difficult due to the challenge of assembling software tools plus associated libraries, connecting tools together into pipelines, and specifying parameters. Here, we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible, but practical in both time and effort. This suite combines three well-tested components—a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and workflow systems that automatically orchestrate the composition of these packages for entire pipelines—to achieve an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility. We also provide a practical implementation and five recommendations to help set a typical researcher on the path to performing data analyses reproducibly. Many areas of research suffer from poor reproducibility, particularly in computationally intensive domains where results rely on a series of complex methodological decisions that are not well captured by traditional publication approaches. Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility, but implementation of these practices remains difficult due to the challenge of assembling software tools plus associated libraries, connecting tools together into pipelines, and specifying parameters. Here, we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible, but practical in both time and effort.

abstract = {Evolving software products is a tricky business, especially when the domain is complex and changing rapidly. Like other fields of engineering, software engineering productivity advances have come about largely through abstraction, reuse, process, and automation (e.g., moving from assembly language to third generation languages offered increased productivity through better abstraction). For canonical or domain applications, model-based engineering (MBE) of software provides a systematic approach for producing software systems that leverage all of these avenues of productivity. Specifying or modeling software at higher levels of abstraction and connecting these representations with previously developed (reusable) components provides a repeatable assembly and transformation process that can often be automated. Since 2004, we have explored MBE for generating software from the high-level for sophisticated agent-based systems, low-level complexity in the details of software-defined radios, and more recently with the maturation of emergent systems found in social networking (i.e., Facebook-like systems). While productivity is a key benefit of MBE in software, there have been few studies that examine productivity. In this paper, we present our experience in these efforts and reflect on some productivity implications. Our experience shows that MBE introduces some complexities early in the product life cycle, but provides a stable basis for better productivity through systematic abstraction, reuse, process, and automation. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {(2) where the summation is over polarizable centers, i. Fluctuating charge model In this method, the atomic charges fluctuate in response to the environment according to the principle of electronega-tivity equalization, which states that charge flows between atoms until the instantaneous electronegativities of the atoms are equal. In this approach, the fluctuating charges (FQs) are assigned fictitious masses and are treated as additional degrees of freedom in the equations of motion. In the context of molecular dynamics, the equations that result are efficiently solved using the extended Lagrangian method [13] at a computational cost little greater than that required for a fixed-charge, pairwise-additive force field. This model has also been implemented, though less effi-ciently, for use in Monte Carlo simulations [14]. Water models Most efforts to develop polarizable force fields have focused on liquid water because its elaborate network of cooperative interactions provides fruitful grounds for test-ing methods and because it plays such a central role in biological processes. In the PD model, the additional empirical parameters are the polarizabilities, $\alpha$, of Equation 1. Some approaches include isotropic point polarizabilities on all atoms. These approaches subdivide into cases in which the molecular polarizability is taken to be a simple additive sum of the atomic polarizabilities [15] and others in which the point polarizabilities interact intramolecularly with those on neighboring atoms (1,2-and 1,3-bonded) [16]. Other force fields place a single point polarizability, often set to the experimental value of 1.444 {\AA} 3 , at the oxygen atom or positioned along the H–O–H bisector [17–19]. In the FQ approach, the parameters that determine the atomic charges and the polarization response can be adjust-ed empirically [13], but have also been fit to reproduce quantum mechanical two-body and three-body (i.e. nonad-ditive) interaction energies for water dimers and trimers [20]. As applied to water, this model, though highly effi-cient, has the disadvantage that the polarizability is confined to the molecular plane, whereas experimentally the polarizability is nearly isotropic.},

In computer science and related computational disciplines such as systems biology, the issues closely revolve around the ability to implement novel algorithms and approaches. Taking an approach from the literature and applying it to a new codebase frequently requires local knowledge missing from the published manuscripts and project websites. Alongside this issue, benchmarking, and the development of fair --- and widely available --- benchmark sets present another barrier. In this paper, we outline several suggestions to address these issues, driven by specific examples from a range of scientific domains. Finally, based on these suggestions, we propose a new open platform for scientific software development which effectively isolates specific dependencies from the individual researcher and their workstation and allows faster, more powerful sharing of the results of scientific software engineering.},

abstract = {Today, computer simulations form an integral part of many research and development efforts. The scope of what can be modeled has increased dramatically, as computing performance improved over the last two decades. But with serial-execution performance of CPUs leveling off, future performance increases for computational physics, material design, and biology must come from higher parallelization. In particular, heterogeneous hardware designs are becoming increasingly important due to their, compared to conventional hardware, inherently larger power efficiency. The currently leading technology are GPU accelerated systems. Offering a five- to tenfold in- crease of cost- and power-efficency, GPU based supercomputers have proliferated rapidly since their introduction in 2008. Now, three of the five world's fastest supercomputers achieve their performance through GPUs. In order to take full advantage of such systems, new programming paradigms have to be applied. This thesis presents a new code for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. LAMMPSCUDA employs GPUs to accelerate simulations of many material classes, including bio-simulations, semiconductors, metals, inorganic glasses, polymer systems, and atomic liquids. Here, details of the implementation, as well as comprehensive performance evaluations will be presented, showing that LAMMPSCUDA can efficiently utilize single workstations and large clusters with hundreds of GPUs. In the second part of this thesis, LAMMPSCUDA will be used to develop a newMDforce field, called BC-U, for ion-conducting glasses of the general composition xLi2O − yB2O3 − zSi2O4 − wP2O5. It will be shown that the new BC-U force-field reproduces composition-dependent, ex- perimental data of structural and ion-dynamics properties for several binary glasses better than established potentials. For this demonstration, extensive simulations of lithium silicate, lithium borate, and lithium phosphate are carried out using several MD force fields. Numerous proper- ties, including coordination numbers, thermal expansion coefficients and conductivity activation energies are determined for a wide range of compositions, and compared to experimental data. On a newly-introduced evaluation scale, the BC-U potential consistently has the highest overall score of all investigated force fields. Moreover, in simulations of lithium borophosphate using the BC-U potential, the mixed network former effect in the activation energies is observed, in agreement with experimental findings. Because it does not occur when simulating borosilicates and phosphosilicates, MD simulations with the BC-U potential can be used to verify proposed microscopical causes of the mixed network former effect. Summarizing, the new BC-U potential is suited to investigate structural properties as well as features of the ion-dynamics, and is the primary choice for future investigations of ion-conducting glasse},

Nevertheless, there remain cases for which the use of brute-force computer simulations is clearly not the solution. In such cases, great benefit can be obtained from the use of physically sound simplifications. The introduction of such coarse graining can be traced back to the early usage of a simplified model in studies of proteins. Since then, the field has progressed tremendously. In this review, we cover both key developments in the field and potential future directions. Additionally, particular emphasis is given to two general approaches, namely the renormalization and reference potential approaches, which allow one to move back and forth between the coarse-grained (CG) and full models, as these approaches provide the foundation for CG modeling of complex systems.},

The ab initio ECP's should facilitate valence electron calculations on molecules containing transition-metal atoms with accuracies approaching all-electron calculations at a fraction of the computational cost. Analytic fits to the potentials are presented for use in multicenter integral evaluation.

Recently, Alml{\"{o}}f, Taylor, and co-workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree-Fock calculations if the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen-containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Alml{\"{o}}f and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of correlation consistent basis sets, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99{\%} of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50{\%} more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94{\%}-97{\%} of the total (HF + 1 + 2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron. {\textcopyright} 1989 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Advances in recent years have made molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations powerful tools in molecular-level research, allowing the prediction of experimental observables in the study of systems such as proteins, membranes, and polymeric materials. However, the quality of any prediction based on molecular dynamics results will strongly depend on the validity of underlying physical assumptions. Unphysical behavior of simulations can have significant influence on the results and reproducibility of these simulations, such as folding of proteins and DNA or properties of lipid bilayers determined by cutoff treatment, dynamics of peptides and polymers affected by the choice of thermostat, or liquid properties depending on the simulation time step. Motivated by such examples, we propose a two-fold approach to increase the robustness of molecular simulations. The first part of this approach involves tests which can be performed by the users of MD programs on their respective systems and setups. We present a number of tests of different complexity, ranging from simple post-processing analysis to more involved tests requiring additional simulations. These tests are shown to significantly increase the reliability of MD simulations by catching a number of common simulation errors violating physical assumptions, such as non-conservative integrators, deviations from the Boltzmann ensemble, and lack of ergodicity between degrees of freedom. To make the usage as easy as possible, we have developed an open-source and platform-independent Python library (https://physical-validation.readthedocs.io) implementing these tests. The second part of the approach involves testing for code correctness. While unphysical behavior can be due to poor or incompatible choices of parameters by the user, it can just as well originate in coding errors within the program. We therefore propose to include physical validation tests in the code-checking mechanism of MD software packages. We have implemented such a validation for the GROMACS software package, ensuring that every major release passes a number of physical sanity checks performed on selected representative systems before shipping. It is, to our knowledge, the first major molecular mechanics software package to run such validation routinely. The tests are, as the rest of the package, open source software, and can be adapted for other software packages.},

abstract = {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C 6R-6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The "double counting" of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene {\textperiodcentered} H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initia calculations of the interaction energies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Computer programming was once thought of as a skill required only by professional software developers. But today, given the ubiquitous nature of computation and data science it is quickly becoming necessary for all scientists and engineers to have at least a basic knowledge of how to program. Teaching how to program, particularly to those students with little or no computing background, is well-known to be a difficult task. However, there is also a wealth of evidence-based teaching practices for teaching programming skills which can be applied to greatly improve learning outcomes and the student experience. Adopting these practices naturally gives rise to greater learning efficiency - this is critical if programming is to be integrated into an already busy geoscience curriculum. This paper considers an undergraduate computer programming course, run during the last 5 years in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. The teaching methodologies that were used each year are discussed alongside the challenges that were encountered, and how the methodologies affected student performance. Anonymised student marks and feedback are used to highlight this, and also how the adjustments made to the course eventually resulted in a highly effective learning environment.},

abstract = {MDAnalysis (http://mdanalysis.org) is a library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. MD simulations of biological molecules have become an important tool to elucidate the relationship between molecular structure and physiological function. Simulations are performed with highly optimized software packages on HPC resources but most codes generate output trajectories in their own formats so that the development of new trajectory analysis algorithms is confined to specific user communities and widespread adoption and further development is delayed. MDAnalysis addresses this problem by abstracting access to the raw simulation data and presenting a uniform object-oriented Python interface to the user. It thus enables users to rapidly write code that is portable and immediately usable in virtually all biomolecular simulation communities. The user interface and modular design work equally well in complex scripted work flows, as foundations for other packages, and for interactive and rapid prototyping work in IPython / Jupyter notebooks, especially together with molecular visualization provided by nglview and time series analysis with pandas. MDAnalysis is written in Python and Cython and uses NumPy arrays for easy interoperability with the wider scientific Python ecosystem. It is widely used and forms the foundation for more specialized biomolecular simulation tools. MDAnalysis is available under the GNU General Public License v2.},

abstract = {Motivation: Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources.Results: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.Availability: GROMACS is an open source and free software available from http://www.gromacs.org.Contact:erik.lindahl@scilifelab.seSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Certain cyanine dye molecules have been observed to self-assemble in DNA templates to form large chiral aggregates, which exhibit induced circular dichroism. The structure and circular dichroism (CD) of one such system, aggregates of a cationic DiSC2(5) cyanine dye, are investigated using the time-dependent Kohn-Sham density functional theory (TD-DFT) and exciton coupling model. A series of TD-DFT calculations on the aggregates with one, two, and four dye molecules clearly shows the onset of CD induced by the helically twisted structure compatible with the minor groove of DNA templates. More simplified exciton coupling model analysis successfully reproduces the major positive Cotton effect observed in the experiment as well as the TD-DFT calculations, but it is unable to capture minor features of the CD spectrum that are closely related to absolute configurations of constituent dyes in the complex. We assess the performance of various methods used for evaluation of the electronic coupling energies between interacting chromophores. Our results confirm that the interchromophore interactions in cyanine dye aggregates are primarily electrostatic in nature and indicate that the exciton coupling model is adequate for studying induced CD of self-assembled aggregates of cyanine dye molecules. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the "dust bowl" era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4 -1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6 -1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding ≈1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We evaluated a series of metacognitive homework assignments (“Scientist Spotlights”) that featured counterstereotypical examples of scientists in an introductory biology class at a diverse community college. Scientist Spotlights additionally served as tools for content coverage, as scientists were selected to match topics covered each week. We analyzed beginning- and end-of-course essays completed by students during each of five courses with Scientist Spotlights and two courses with equivalent homework assignments that lacked connections to the stories of diverse scientists. Students completing Scientist Spotlights shifted toward counterstereotypical descriptions of scientists and conveyed an enhanced ability to personally relate to scientists following the intervention. Longitudinal data suggested these shifts were maintained 6 months after the completion of the course. Analyses further uncovered correlations between these shifts, interest in science, and course grades. As Scientist Spotlights require very little class time and complement existing curricula, they represent a promising tool for enhancing science identity, shifting stereotypes, and connecting content to issues of equity and diversity in a broad range of STEM classrooms.},

abstract = {A reproducibility crisis is a situation where many scientific studies cannot be reproduced. Inappropriate practices of science, such as HARKing, p-hacking, and selective reporting of positive results, have been suggested as causes of irreproducibility. In this editorial, I propose that a lack of raw data or data fabrication is another possible cause of irreproducibility. As an Editor-in-Chief of Molecular Brain, I have handled 180 manuscripts since early 2017 and have made 41 editorial decisions categorized as "Revise before review," requesting that the authors provide raw data. Surprisingly, among those 41 manuscripts, 21 were withdrawn without providing raw data, indicating that requiring raw data drove away more than half of the manuscripts. I rejected 19 out of the remaining 20 manuscripts because of insufficient raw data. Thus, more than 97{\%} of the 41 manuscripts did not present the raw data supporting their results when requested by an editor, suggesting a possibility that the raw data did not exist from the beginning, at least in some portions of these cases. Considering that any scientific study should be based on raw data, and that data storage space should no longer be a challenge, journals, in principle, should try to have their authors publicize raw data in a public database or journal site upon the publication of the paper to increase reproducibility of the published results and to increase public trust in science.},

abstract = {The calculation of the vibrational structure associated to electronic spectra in large molecules requires a Taylor expansion of the initial and final state potential energy surface (PES) around some reference nuclear structure. Vertical (V) and adiabatic (A) approaches expand the final state PES around the initial-state (V) or final-state (A) equilibrium structure. Simplest models only take into account displacements of initial- and final-state minima, intermediate ones also allow for difference in frequencies and more accurate models introduce the Dushinsky effect through the computation of the Hessians of both the initial and final state. In this contribution we summarize and compare the mathematical expressions of the complete hierarchy of V and A harmonic models and we implement them in a numerical code, presenting a detailed comparison of their performance on a number of prototypical systems. We also address non-Condon effects through linear expansions of the transition dipole as a function of nuclear coordinates (Herzberg-Teller effect) and compare the results of expansions around initial and final state equilibrium geometries. By a throughout analysis of our results we highlight a number of general trends in the relative performance of the models that can provide hints for their proper choice. Moreover we show that A and V models including final state PES Hessian outperform the simpler ones and that discrepancies in their predictions are diagnostic for failure of harmonic approximation and/or of Born-Oppenheimer approximation (existence of remarkable geometry-dependent mixing of electronic states). {\textcopyright} 2012 the Owner Societies.},

Particular care has been devoted to generality, modularity, and numerical stability including all the contributions that play a role at the harmonic level of approximation, namely Franck-Condon, Herzberg-Teller, and Dushinsky (i.e., mode mixing) effects. The implementation shares the same general framework of our previous time-independent (TI) model, thus allowing an effective integration between both approaches with the consequent enhancement of their respective strengths (e.g., spectrum completeness and straightforward account of temperature effects for the TD route versus band resolution and assignment for the TI route) using a single set of starting data. Implementation of both models in the same general computer program allows comprehensive studies using several levels of electronic structure description together with effective account of environmental effects by atomistic and/or continuum models of different sophistication.

abstract = {Numerous computational science platforms, including EDISON, have broken the previous education focused on theory and providing practical and experiential educational services with various simulation tools and educational contents. This paper analyzed the effectiveness and usability through a survey of university e-lectures and educational competitions using EDISON for better service improvement. In this survey six disciplines were chosen: computational fluid dynamics, nano-electronic device and general physics, computational chemistry, structural analysis, computer aided optimal design, computational bio-medicine. Interestingly, according to the results of the survey, users of each computational science field were already familiar with the user interfaces of the simulation tools they had used before EDISON, and hoped that EDISON would have similar one. In addition, although the effectiveness of learning has been improved through practice, it is difficult for first learners because of quantitative and qualitative shortage of user and theory manuals. Lastly, the most important factor was the lecturer's explanation to use the computational science platform and find the meaning of the simulation results. To sum up, back-ups which are documentation and lecturer's assistances should be accompanied outside simulation workflows. In the last stage, this study searched for ways to improve the quality through summarizing the requirements, and proposed the direction of EDISON in the future.},

abstract = {ConspectusHierarchical self-assembly (HAS) is a multilevel organization process that first assembles elementary molecular units into ordered secondary structures via noncovalent interactions, which further act as the building blocks to form more complex multifunctional superstructures at the next level(s). The HAS strategy has been used as a versatile method for the preparation of soft-matter nanoarchitectures of defined size and morphologies, tunable luminescence, and biological importance. However, such preparation can be greatly simplified if well-defined dynamic structures are employed as the cores that upon linking form the desired nanoarchitectures. Discrete supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) with well-defined shapes, sizes, and internal cavities have been widely employed to construct hierarchical systems with functional diversity. This Account summarizes the prevailing strategies used in recent years in the preparation of SCC-based HASs and illustrates how the combination of dynamic metal-ligand coordination with other interactions was used to obtain hierarchical systems with interesting properties.HASs with dual orthogonal interactions involving coordination-driven self-assembly and hydrogen bonding/host-guest interaction generally result in robust and flexible supramolecular gels. Likewise, hybridization of SCCs with a suitable dynamic covalent network via a hierarchical strategy is useful to prepare materials with self-healing properties. The intrinsic positive charges of the SCCs also make them suitable precursors for the construction of HASs via electrostatic interactions with negatively charged biological/abiological molecules. Furthermore, the interplay between the hydrophilic and lipophilic characters of HASs by varying the number and spacial orientation of alkyl/oxyethylene chains of the SCC is a simple yet controllable approach to prepare ordered and tunable nanostructures. Certain SCC-cored hierarchical systems exhibit reversible polymorphism, typically between micellar, nanofiber, and vesicular phases, in response to various external perturbations: heat, photoirradiation, pH-variance, redox-active agents, etc. At the same time, multiple noncovalent interaction mediated HASs are growing in numbers and are promising candidates for obtaining functionally diverse materials.The photophysical properties of SCC-based HASs have been used in many analytical applications. For example, embedding tetraphenylethene (TPE)-based pyridyl ligands within metallo-supramolecular structures partially restricts the molecular rotations of its phenyl rings, endowing the resultant SCCs with weak emissions. Further aggregation of such HASs in suitable solvents results in a marked enhancement in emission intensity along with quantum yields. They act as sensitive sensors for different analytes, including pathogens, drugs, etc. HASs are also useful to develop multidrug systems with cooperative chemotherapeutic effects. Hence, the use of HASs with theranostic SCCs combining cell-imaging agents and chemotherapeutic scaffolds is a promising drug delivery strategy for cancer theranostics. At the same time, their responsiveness to stimuli, oftentimes due to the dynamic nature of the metal-ligand interactions, play an important role in drug release via a disassembly mechanism.},

Cryo-TEM visualizes for the first time directly the rodlike morphology of the J-aggregates. A rod diameter of 2.3 ± 0.2 nm is estimated. Absorption spectroscopy shows that J-aggregation is a strong function of dye concentration and starts in dilute solution before the viscosity increases and mesophases appear. For a 12.5 × 10-3 mol solution, the length of the J-aggregates is on the order of 350 nm, which corresponds to aggregation numbers of ≈3000. Optical microscope textures reveal columnar nematic and hexagonal phases at higher dye concentrations. Structural alternatives for the molecular packing within the J-aggregate based on the estimated rod geometry are discussed. A quasi-two-dimensional superstructure is proposed which could better explain the optical properties of the J-aggregates than previous models. {\textcopyright} 2000 American Chemical Society.},

While adequate representations of DNA exist at the atomic and continuum level, there is a relative lack of models capable of describing the behavior of DNA at mesoscopic length scales. We present a mesoscale model of DNA that reduces the complexity of a nucleotide to three interactions sites, one each for the phosphate, sugar, and base, thereby rendering the investigation of DNA up to a few microns in length computationally tractable. The charges on these sites are considered explicitly. The model is parametrized using thermal denaturation experimental data at a fixed salt concentration. The validity of the model is established by its ability to predict several aspects of DNA behavior, including salt-dependent melting, bubble formation and rehybridization, and the mechanical properties of the molecule as a function of salt concentration.},

abstract = {Control over the morphology of the active layer of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells is paramount to achieve high-efficiency devices. However, no method currently available can predict morphologies for a novel donor-acceptor blend. An approach which allows reaching relevant length scales, retaining chemical specificity, and mimicking experimental fabrication conditions, and which is suited for high-throughput schemes has been proven challenging to find. Here, we propose a method to generate atom-resolved morphologies of BHJs which conforms to these requirements. Coarse-grain (CG) molecular dynamics simulations are employed to simulate the large-scale morphological organization during solution-processing. The use of CG models which retain chemical specificity translates into a direct path to the rational design of donor and acceptor compounds which differ only slightly in chemical nature. Finally, the direct retrieval of fully atomistic detail is possible through backmapping, opening the way for improved quantum mechanical calculations addressing the charge separation mechanism. The method is illustrated for the poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) mixture, and found to predict morphologies in agreement with experimental data. The effect of drying rate, P3HT molecular weight, and thermal annealing are investigated extensively, resulting in trends mimicking experimental findings. The proposed methodology can help reduce the parameter space which has to be explored before obtaining optimal morphologies not only for BHJ solar cells but also for any other solution-processed soft matter device.},

abstract = {Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) studies suggest that TTBC molecules self-assemble in aqueous solution to form single-walled tubes with a diameter of about 35 {\AA}. In order to reveal the arrangement and mutual orientations of the individual molecules in the tube, we combine information from crystal structure data of this dye with a calculation of linear absorbance and linear dichroism spectra and molecular dynamics simulations. We start with wrapping crystal planes in different directions to obtain tubes of suitable diameter. This set of tube models is evaluated by comparing the resulting optical spectra with experimental data. The tubes that can explain the spectra are investigated further by molecular dynamics simulations, including explicit solvent molecules. From the trajectories of the most stable tube models, the short-range ordering of the dye molecules is extracted and the optimization of the structure is iteratively completed. The final structural model is a tube of rings with 6-fold rotational symmetry, where neighboring rings are rotated by 30° and the transition dipole moments of the chromophores form an angle of 74° with respect to the symmetry axis of the tube. This model is in agreement with cryo-TEM images and can explain the optical spectra, consisting of a sharp red-shifted J-band that is polarized parallel to to the symmetry axis of the tube and a broad blue-shifted H-band polarized perpendicular to this axis. The general structure of the homogeneous spectrum of this hybrid HJ-aggregate is described by an analytical model that explains the difference in redistribution of oscillator strength inside the vibrational manifolds of the J- and H-bands and the relative intensities and excitation energies of those bands. In addition to the particular system investigated here, the present methodology can be expected to aid the structure prediction for a wide range of self-assembled dye aggregates.},

abstract = {Bottom-up multiscale techniques are frequently used to develop coarse-grained (CG) models for simulations at extended length and time scales but are often limited by a compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy. The conventional approach to CG nonbonded interactions uses pair potentials which, while computationally efficient, can neglect the inherently multibody contributions of the local environment of a site to its energy, due to degrees of freedom that were coarse-grained out. This effect often causes the CG potential to depend strongly on the overall system density, composition, or other properties, which limits its transferability to states other than the one at which it was parameterized. Here, we propose to incorporate multibody effects into CG potentials through additional nonbonded terms, beyond pair interactions, that depend in a mean-field manner on local densities of different atomic species. This approach is analogous to embedded atom and bond-order models that seek to capture multibody electronic effects in metallic systems. We show that the relative entropy coarse-graining framework offers a systematic route to parameterizing such local density potentials. We then characterize this approach in the development of implicit solvation strategies for interactions between model hydrophobes in an aqueous environment.},

abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parame- terized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 {\textperiodcentered}R−6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometal- lic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol−1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van derWaals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 {\textperiodcentered} R−6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {Crystal engineering, the design of molecular solids, is the synthesis of functional solid-state structures from neutral or ionic building blocks, using intermolecular interactions in the design strategy. Hydrogen bonds, coordination bonds, and other less directed interactions define substructural patterns, referred to in the literature as supramolecular synthons and secondary building units. Crystal engineering has considerable overlap with supramolecular chemistry, X-ray crystallography, materials science, and solid-state chemistry and yet it is a distinct discipline in itself. The subject goes beyond the traditional divisions of organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry, and this makes for a very eclectic blend of ideas and techniques. The purpose of this Review is to highlight some current challenges in this rapidly evolving subject. Among the topics discussed are the nature of intermolecular interactions and their role in crystal design, the sometimes diverging perceptions of the geometrical and chemical models for a molecular crystal, the relationship of these models to polymorphism, knowledge-based computational prediction of crystal structures, and efforts at mapping the pathway of the crystallization reaction. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

@article{Grimme2011,
abstract = {It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard “zero-damping” formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found.For the noncovalently- bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional.},

The method automatically selects the relevant vibronic contributions to the spectrum, independent of their frequency, and it is able to provide fully converged spectra with a quite modest computational time, both in vacuo and in condensed phase. Starting from the rigorous time-dependent expression they discuss indeed in which limits the spectrum of a molecule embedded in a solvent, described as a polarizable continuum, can be computed in a time-independent formalism, defining both nonequilibrium and equilibrium limits. In these cases the polarizable continuum model provides a suitable description of the solvent field. By computing the absorption spectra of anthracene in gas phase and of coumarin C153 in gas phase and cyclohexane, and the phosphorescence spectrum of the unsubstituted coumarin in ethanol they show that the method is fast and efficient. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

Comparison of the perspectives of faculty and their students revealed considerable agreement on the nature, range, and extent of students' UR gains. Specific student gains relating to the process of “becoming a scientist” were described and illustrated by both groups. Faculty framed these gains as part of professional socialization into the sciences. In contrast, students emphasized their personal and intellectual development, with little awareness of their socialization into professional practice. Viewing study findings through the lens of social constructivist learning theories demonstrates that the characteristics of theseURprograms, howfaculty practice URin these colleges, and students' outcomes—including cognitive and personal growth and the development of a professional identity—strongly exemplify many facets of these theories, particularly, student-centered and situated learning as part of cognitive apprenticeship in a community of practice.

abstract = {The authors extend their recent method for the computation of vibrationally resolved optical spectra of large molecules, including both the Duschinsky rotation and the effect of finite temperature in the framework of the Franck-Condon (FC) approximation, to deal with the more general case of the Herzberg-Teller (HT) model, where also the linear dependence of the transition dipole moment on the nuclear coordinates is taken into account. This generalization allows us to investigate weak and vibronically allowed transitions by far extending the range of application of the method. The calculation of the spectra of sizable molecules is computationally demanding because of the huge number of final vibrational states that must be taken into account, and the inclusion of HT terms further increases the computational burden. The method presented here automatically selects the relevant vibronic contributions to the spectrum, independent of their frequency, and it is able to provide fully converged spectra with a modest computational requirement. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by computing the HT absorption and fluorescence Qx spectra of free-base porphyrin both at T=0 K and at room temperature, performing for the first time an exact treatment of vibrations in harmonic approximation. Qx spectra are compared to experiments and FC/HT interferences are analyzed in detail. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Unfortunately, the original presentation of WHAM by Kumar et al. is not directly applicable to data generated by these methods. WHAM was originally formulated to combine data from independent samplings of the canonical ensemble, whereas many generalized-ensemble algorithms sample from mixtures of canonical ensembles at different temperatures. Sorting configurations generated from a parallel tempering simulation by temperature obscures the temporal correlation in the data and results in an improper treatment of the statistical uncertainties used in constructing the estimate of the density of states. Here we present variants of WHAM, STWHAM and PTWHAM, derived with the same set of assumptions, that can be directly applied to several generalized ensemble algorithms, including simulated tempering, parallel tempering (better known as replica-exchange among temperatures), and replica-exchange simulated tempering. We present methods that explicitly capture the considerable temporal correlation in sequentially generated configurations using autocorrelation analysis. This allows estimation of the statistical uncertainty in WHAM estimates of expectations for the canonical ensemble. We test the method with a one-dimensional model system and then apply it to the estimation of potentials of mean force from parallel tempering simulations of the alanine dipeptide in both implicit and explicit solvent. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A new set of united-atom Lennard-Jones interaction parameters for n-alkanes is proposed from fitting to critical temperatures and saturated liquid densities. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to determine the vapor-liquid coexistence curves for methane to dodecane using three united-atom force fields: OPLS [Jorgensen, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984, 106, 813], SKS [Siepmann, et al. Nature 1993, 365, 330], and TraPPE. Standard specific densities and the high-pressure equation-of-state for the transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE) model were studied by simulations in the isobaric-isothermal and canonical ensembles, respectively. It is found that one set of methyl and methylene parameters is sufficient to accurately describe the fluid phases of all n-alkanes with two or more carbon atoms. Whereas other n-alkane force fields employ methyl groups that are either equal or larger in size than the methylene groups, it is demonstrated here that using a smaller methyl group yields a better fit to the set of experimental data. As should be expected from an effective pair potential, the new parameters do not reproduce experimental second virial coefficients. Saturated vapor pressures and densities show small, but systematic deviation from the experimental data.},

abstract = {Cyanine derivatives, named from the Greek word kyanos meaning dark-blue, were discovered more than 150 years ago and remain one of the most widely used classes of organic dyes with contemporary applications in photography (panchromatic emulsions), information storage (CD-R and DVD-R media) and biochemistry (DNA and protein labeling) fields. Cyanine chromogens consist of a charged $\pi$-conjugated segment containing an odd number of sp2 carbon atoms with the chain capped at the extremities by two electronegative centers, typically nitrogen or oxygen atoms. Cyanines are characterized by a vanishing bond length alternation indicating nearly equal carbon-carbon bond lengths, as well as a very intense and sharp absorption band presenting a shoulder. This hallmark band undergoes a strong red shift when the chain is extended. This so-called vinyl shift is extremely large (ca. 100 nm for each pair of carbon atoms added in the $\pi$-conjugated path), making cyanines ideal building blocks for the design of devices with near-infrared applications. Numerous cyanines also exhibit emission bands with large quantum yields. These exceptional optical properties explain why both canonical cyanines and the corresponding fluoroborates (e.g., boron-dipyrromethene, BODIPY) remain the focus of an ever-growing body of experimental work.In turn, this popularity has stimulated quantum mechanical investigations aiming, on the one hand, at probing the specific electronic nature of cyanine dyes and, on the other hand, at helping to design new dyes. However, the adiabatic approximation to time-dependent density functional theory, the most widespread ab initio model for electronically excited states, fails to accurately reproduce the absorption spectra of cyanine derivatives: it yields a systematic and large underestimation of the experimental wavelengths irrespective of the details of the computational protocol. In contrast, highly correlated wave function approaches provide accurate transition energies for model systems but are hardly applicable to real-life cyanines and BODIPY. This indicates that setting up a computationally tractable theoretical protocol that provides both robust and accurate optical spectra for cyanine-based dyes is a major challenge that has only been taken up lately.In this Account, we compile the most recent advances in the field by considering both compact streptocyanines and large fluoroborates. For the former, we summarize the key results obtained with a large panel of theoretical approaches, allowing us not only to understand the origin of the cyanine challenge but also to pinpoint the schemes presenting the most promising accuracy/effort ratio. For the latter, we show via selected examples how theoretical models can be used to reproduce simultaneously experimental band shapes and transition energies, thus paving the way to an efficient in silico design of new compounds.

abstract = {This review gives an introduction into supramolecular chemistry describing in the first part general principles, focusing on terms like noncovalent interaction, molecular recognition, self-assembly, and supramolecular function. In the second part those will be illustrated by simple examples from our laboratories. Supramolecular chemistry is the science that bridges the gap between the world of molecules and nanotechnology. In supramolecular chemistry noncovalent interactions occur between molecular building blocks, which by molecular recognition and self-assembly form (functional) supramolecular entities. It is also termed the "chemistry of the noncovalent bond." Molecular recognition is based on geometrical complementarity based on the "key-and-lock" principle with nonshape-dependent effects, e.g., solvatization, being also highly influential. Self-assembly leads to the formation of well-defined aggregates. Hereby the overall structure of the target ensemble is controlled by the symmetry features of the certain building blocks. Finally, the aggregates can possess special properties or supramolecular functions, which are only found in the ensemble but not in the participating molecules. This review gives an introduction on supramolecular chemistry and illustrates the fundamental principles by recent examples from our group.},

@article{Hollender2010,
abstract = {With the continually increasing complexity of e-learning environments, there is a need for integrating concepts of cognitive load theory (CLT) with concepts of human-computer interaction (HCI). Basic concepts of both fields were reviewed and contrasted. A literature review was conducted within the literature database "The Guide to Computing Literature," searching for "cognitive load theory" and "Sweller." Sixty-five publications contained "cognitive load" in their titles or abstracts. Each publication was checked to see whether it contained the concepts of intrinsic, extraneous, or germane cognitive load. The review showed that CLT concepts have been adopted in HCI. However, the concept of germane cognitive load has attracted less attention up to the present time. Two conceptual models are proposed. The first model divides extraneous cognitive load into load induced by the instructional design and load caused by software usage. The model clarifies the focus of traditional usability principles and of existing instructional design principles derived from CLT. The second model fits CLT concepts into the basic components of user-centered design. The concept of germane cognitive load illustrates that an increase of cognitive load can be desirable when designing e-learning environments. Areas for future interdisciplinary research are sketched. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Systems composed of soft matter (e.g., liquids, polymers, foams, gels, colloids, and most biological materials) are ubiquitous in science and engineering, but molecular simulations of such systems pose particular computational challenges, requiring time and/or ensemble-averaged data to be collected over long simulation trajectories for property evaluation. Performing a molecular simulation of a soft matter system involves multiple steps, which have traditionally been performed by researchers in a "bespoke" fashion, resulting in many published soft matter simulations not being reproducible based on the information provided in the publications. To address the issue of reproducibility and to provide tools for computational screening, we have been developing the open-source Molecular Simulation and Design Framework (MoSDeF) software suite. In this paper, we propose a set of principles to create Transparent, Reproducible, Usable by others, and Extensible (TRUE) molecular simulations. MoSDeF facilitates the publication and dissemination of TRUE simulations by automating many of the critical steps in molecular simulation, thus enhancing their reproducibility. We provide several examples of TRUE molecular simulations: All of the steps involved in creating, running and extracting properties from the simulations are distributed on open-source platforms (within MoSDeF and on GitHub), thus meeting the definition of TRUE simulations.},

abstract = {This work critically examines attempts to model the fine structure apparent in electronic spectra of cyanine dyes and their analogues. Numerous computational studies reported over the past decade attribute the origin of sub-bands and their relative intensities to vibronic transitions in which the relevant electronic transition is coupled, irrespective of symmetry, with a collection of vibrations. It is contended that this type of approach is not supported by experimental evidence. An argument is reiterated for a more appropriate model that adheres closely to fundamental principles and fits the data. It stipulates that essentially just one symmetric vibration, carbon–carbon bond stretching of the cyanine polymethine chain, dominates the coupling and is responsible for the observed fine structure. Furthermore, it is pointed out that the intensities of the sub-bands are readily explained by means of the Franck–Condon principle.},

While a decade ago minimalist toy models were mainly designed to test general hypotheses on the principles regulating protein folding, the latest coarse-grained models are increasingly realistic and can be used to characterize quantitatively the detailed folding mechanism of specific proteins. The ability of such models to reproduce the essential features of folding dynamics suggests that each single atomic degree of freedom is not by itself particularly relevant to folding and supports a statistical mechanical approach to characterize folding transitions. When combined with more refined models and with experimental studies, the systematic investigation of protein systems and complexes using coarse-grained models can advance our theoretical understanding of the actual organizing principles that emerge from the complex network of interactions among protein atomic constituents. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This Perspective discusses the physics, implementation and findings of Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) models applied to organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). It is shown that KMC models can relate morphology and energy levels on the nano-scale to geminate and non-geminate recombination, charge transport, charge injection and charge extraction me asured in macro-scale OPVs. In particular, KMC investigations probing the circumstances under which geminate recombination is, and is not, a significant loss mechanism in OPVs are reviewed. Furthermore, the mechanisms which yield non-geminate (bimolecular) recombination in OPVs that is both slower than the predictions of Langevin, and charge density dependent, are discussed. It is also shown how KMC models can predict average mobility, as well as spatial heterogeneity and temporal dispersion around this average value in disordered bulk heterojunctions. Finally, it is shown how KMC can be used to quantify the effect of non-ideal electrodes, interlayers and surface wetting layers on OPV performance.},

We first demonstrate our method is able to describe the effects of force field changes in capped alanine dipeptide after learning a model using AMBER99. We further provide a simple extension to variational dynamics encoders that allows the model to be trained in a more efficient manner on larger systems by encoding the outputs of a linear transformation using time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA). Using this technique, we show how such a model trained for one protein, the WW domain, can efficiently be transferred to perform enhanced sampling on a related mutant protein, the GTT mutation.

However, anion supramolecular chemistry has developed substantially beyond anion recognition, and now encompasses a diverse range of disciplines. Dramatic advance has been made in the anion-templated synthesis of macrocycles and interlocked molecular architectures, while the study of transmembrane anion transporters has flourished from almost nothing into a rapidly maturing field of research. The supramolecular chemistry of anions has also found real practical use in a variety of applications such as catalysis, ion extraction, and the use of anions as stimuli for responsive chemical systems.},

abstract = {In this work, an extension is proposed to the standard iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) method used to derive coarse-grained potentials. It is shown that the inclusion of target data from multiple states yields a less state-dependent potential, and is thus better suited to simulate systems over a range of thermodynamic states than the standard IBI method. The inclusion of target data from multiple states forces the algorithm to sample regions of potential phase space that match the radial distribution function at multiple state points, thus producing a derived potential that is more representative of the underlying interactions. It is shown that the algorithm is able to converge to the true potential for a system where the underlying potential is known. It is also shown that potentials derived via the proposed method better predict the behavior of n-alkane chains than those derived via the standard IBI method. Additionally, through the examination of alkane monolayers, it is shown that the relative weight given to each state in the fitting procedure can impact bulk system properties, allowing the potentials to be further tuned in order to match the properties of reference atomistic and/or experimental systems.},

@article{Wu2005a,
abstract = {We consider ways to quantify the overlap of the parts of phase space important to two systems, labeled A and B. Of interest is how much of the A-important phase space lies in that important to B, and how much of B lies in A. Two measures are proposed. The first considers four total-energy distributions, formed from all combinations made by tabulating either the A-system or the B-system energy when sampling either the A or B system. Measures for A in B and B in A are given by two overlap integrals defined on pairs of these distributions. The second measure is based on information theory, and defines two relative entropies which are conveniently expressed in terms of the dissipated work for free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations in the A--{\textgreater}B and B--{\textgreater}A directions, respectively. Phase-space overlap is an important consideration in the performance of free-energy calculations. To demonstrate this connection, we examine bias in FEP calculations applied to a system of independent particles in a harmonic potential. Systems are selected to represent a range of overlap situations, including extreme subset, subset, partial overlap, and nonoverlap. The magnitude and symmetry of the bias (A--{\textgreater}B vs B--{\textgreater}A) are shown to correlate well with the overlap, and consequently with the overlap measures. The relative entropies are used to scale the amount of sampling to obtain a universal bias curve. This result leads to develop a simple heuristic that can be applied to determine whether a work-based free-energy measurement is free of bias. The heuristic is based in part on the measured free energy, but we argue that it is fail-safe inasmuch as any bias in the measurement will not promote a false indication of accuracy.},

abstract = {Certain molecular aggregates consisting of organic dyes are remarkable in exhibiting an intense and very narrow absorption peak, known as a J-band, which is red-shifted away from the region of monomer absorption. Apart from those dyes showing the J-band on aggregation, there are also dyes where the absorption maximum is shifted to higher energies. The width of the resulting absorption band (called an H-band) is comparable to that of the monomeric dyes and shows a complicated vibrational structure. Following our analysis of the J-band spectra of polymer aggregates using the CES approximation [A. Eisfeld, J.S. Briggs, Chem. Phys. 281 (2002) 61], a theory that includes vibrations explicitly, we show that the same approximation can account for measured H-band spectra. Using simple analytical forms of the monomer spectrum the origin of the widely different shapes of H- and J-bands is explained within the CES approximation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30{\%} for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1.

abstract = {Since 1992 a variety of urea-based anion receptors have been synthesised, of varying complexity and sophistication. This critical review will focus on some distinctive aspects of anion recognition by urea derivatives, with a special reference to: (i) design and synthesis, (ii) methodologies for the investigation of the receptor–anion interaction in solution, (iii) the interpretation of the solution behaviour on the basis of the structural interplay between the receptor and the anion. It will be shown that the efficiency of urea as a receptor subunit depends on the presence of two proximate polarised N–H fragments, capable (i) of chelating a spherical anion or (ii) of donating two parallel H-bonds to the oxygen atoms of a carboxylate or of an inorganic oxoanion, a property which is shared with other diamides, e.g. squaramide. The wide use of urea in the design of neutral anion receptors seems to depends on the ease of its synthesis, in particular through the reaction of a primary amine group with an isocyanate, which allows the high-yield preparation of symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted derivatives (83 references). {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {A series of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) functionalized with urea hydrogen-bonding groups has been synthesized and structurally analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction to evaluate the efficacy of anion coordination by urea within the structural constraints of the MOFs. We found that urea-based functionalities may be used for anion binding within metal-organic frameworks when the tendency for urea⋯urea self-association is decreased by strengthening the intramolecular CH⋯O hydrogen bonding of N-phenyl substituents to the carbonyl oxygen atom. Theoretical calculations indicate that N,N′-bis(m-pyridyl)urea (BPU) and N,N′-bis(m-cyanophenyl)urea (BCPU) should have enhanced hydrogen-bonding donor abilities toward anions and decreased tendencies to self-associate into hydrogen-bonded tapes compared to other disubstituted ureas. Accordingly, BPU and BCPU were incorporated in MOFs as linkers through coordination of various Zn, Cu, and Ag transition metal salts, including Zn(ClO4)2, ZnSO4, Cu(NO 3)2, Cu(CF3SO3)2, AgNO3, and AgSO3CH3. Structural analysis by single-crystal X-ray diffraction showed that these linkers are versatile anion binders, capable of chelate hydrogen bonding to all of the oxoanions explored. Anion coordination by the urea functionalities was found to successfully compete with urea self-association in all cases except for that of charge-diffuse perchlorate. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},
