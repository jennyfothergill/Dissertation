\section{Crystal Structure Determination of \texorpdfstring{Mo(CO)$_{5}$}{Mo(CO)5}(\textit{p}CNHDPU)}
X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a Bruker D8 Venture using MoK$\alpha$-radiation ($\lambda$ = 0.71073 \AA). Data have been corrected for absorption using SADABS \citep{Sheldrick1996} area detector absorption correction program. Using Olex2 \citep{Dolomanov2009}, the structure was solved with the SHELXT \citep{Sheldrick2015a} structure solution program using Direct Methods and refined with the SHELXL \citep{Sheldrick2015} refinement package using least squares minimization. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms attached to heteroatoms were found from the residual density maps, placed, and refined with isotropic thermal parameters. All other hydrogen atoms in the investigated structure were located from difference Fourier maps but finally their positions were placed in geometrically calculated positions, and refined using a riding model. Isotropic thermal parameters of the placed hydrogen atoms were fixed to 1.2 times the \textit{U} value of the atoms they are linked to (1.5 times for methyl groups). Calculations and refinement of structures were carried out using APEX2 \citep{Bruker2016}, SHELXTL \citep{Sheldrick2008}, and Olex2 software. Graphical representations of crystallographic data were generated using the Mercury software package \citep{Macrae2008a}.
