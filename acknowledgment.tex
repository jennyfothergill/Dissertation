I am exceptionally grateful to my advisors, Dr. Eric Jankowski and Dr. Matt King, for their support, patience, and advice. 
I could not have asked for better advisors; they have motivated me to grow as a person while helping me tailor this project to achieve my goals.
My time in Dr. Jankowski's lab has been a joy; he has worked to cultivate a welcoming and collaborative environment that prioritizes teamwork and kindness, and I consider myself very lucky to have been a part of it.
I want to sincerely thank my labmates for their encouragement which helped me develop confidence as a molecular scientist, their willingness to take the time to work through a problem together, and their kindness and humor.
I also want to thank my collaborators in the open-source software community, in particular the Molecular Simulation and Design Framework (MoSDeF), HOOMD, and Signac framework.
Their kindness in welcoming my first contributions has helped develop my passion to promote inclusivity for others, and for that I am very grateful.
Last but not least, I want to thank my family and friends for their understanding and support throughout my PhD and my life in general.
