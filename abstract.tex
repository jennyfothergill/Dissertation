Reproducibility is a key principle of the scientific method.
Through reproduction, the results of an experiment can be validated, strengthening the original conclusions.
However, there are many barriers which stand in the way of reproducibility, especially in molecular simulation.
Many of these issues can be fixed through automation, generalization, and packaging.
We automate initialization, job submission, and forcefield management through the incorporation of tools from the Molecular Simulation and Design Framework (MoSDeF). 
This dissertation will present development of infrastructure and workflows that help manage, initialize, and analyze molecular simulation results in a transparent, reproducible, usable by others, and extensible way. 
Two scientific applications will be explored.
A screening study where we validate that the structures self-assembled by P3HT show the same structure and state dependency as in prior work using a different model.
And a multi-university collaborative reproducibility study where we examine modeling choices that give rise to differences between simulation engines.
