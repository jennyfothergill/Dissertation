\section{Introduction}
%% background
Reproducibility in science is a crucial issue.
If the goal of science is to expand the knowledge of humankind, making sure experiments are reproducible helps to lay a strong foundation for the next discovery.
In computational molecular simulation, where all parameters can be controlled, it would seem an easy task to reproduce an existing work.
Molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation are both driven by the core principles of statistical thermodynamics.
However, various codes exist each with their own algorithms and implementations, but if they are correctly using the core principles, the end result should be the same.

This study aims to learn whether different codes can get the same result using the same model.
Within the umbrella of model is the thermodynamic ensemble (e.g., NVT, NPT), the representation of the system (e.g., the force field, constraints, cut offs), and the statepoint (i.e., the pressure, temperature).
In this framework, a "force field" is defined to supply the parameters for a given model.
Other details related to the model: rigid, long-range and charged interactions.

Using the same forcefield may not ensure reproducibility between engines: different engines lack consistency in the functional forms, implementations, and options for handling long-range and charged interactions \citep{Rizzi2020}. 
The energy calculated with a certain code has been found to depend on how the charges are calculated (whether the charge method uses the whole molecule or fragment) and which method is used is often not reported---even differences in Coulomb's constant may cause different results \citep{Shirts2017}.
Due to differences in available implementations in the difference engines there is no one size fits all protocol \citep{Loeffler2018}.
Systematic error was found between engines in as simple a task as calculating the potential energy and density of uncharged molecules in the liquid phase, even between groups using the same engine \citep{Schappals2017}.

%Software errors. 
%Algorithmic errors: Running long enough and large enough, interaction cutoffs, choice of %thermostat/barostat \citep{Hunenberger2005}.
%User errors: (1) specifying the model, (2) specifying the scenario, (3) controlling the algorithms %(physical, numerical), (4) controlling the compilation, (5) controlling the actual simulation run, and %(6) controlling the evaluation of the simulation results. 

%% what is this study
This study, a multi-university collaboration, aims to determine what information is necessary to achieve statistically same results across engines.
Researchers from eight universities (see \autoref{tab:unis}) contributed to scripts to initialize and run each of these systems.
Six different engines (see \autoref{tab:engines}) were used to conduct molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.
These scripts will use tools from the Molecular Simulation and Design Framework (MoSDeF) to help with reproducible simulation initialization.
In order to help manage this large data space and submission to various clusters, the Signac framework will be used to programmatically organize the statepoint directories and handle the idiosyncrasies of different cluster schedulers.

This study is still ongoing, but we have learned that even when you control every step of the initialization process, there are still so many additional user-tuned parameters in each engine that guaranteeing reproducibility requires careful thought.

\section{Models}
The systems which are studied are small, simple, and chosen to demonstrate simulation in systems with varied degrees of complexity:
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/rep_study/models.png}
    \caption{Structures of the five models with the atoms types labelled: (a) TraPPE-UA methane, (b) TraPPE-UA pentane, (c) TraPPE-UA benzene, (d) SPC/E water, (e) OPLSAA ethanol}\label{fig:models}
\end{figure}
The TraPPE united-atom (UA) forcefield was applied to UA methane (see \autoref{fig:models}a) and pentane (see \autoref{fig:models}b) models to investigate the simplest case of only Lennard-Jones interactions and a linear molecule with bonds, angles and dihedrals \citep{Martin1998}.
TraPPE-UA was also applied to a UA benzene model (see \autoref{fig:models}c) to investigate rigid ring structures.
(We initially tried a flexible model based on TraPPE-UA, but some engines were not able to get this model to run \citep{Yiannourakou2019}.)
The SPC/E water model (see \autoref{fig:models}d) was used to investigate a rigid molecule with electrostatics \citep{Berendsen1987a}.
Finally, the most complex system, the OPLS all-atom (AA) forcefield was applied to ethanol (see \autoref{fig:models}e) to investigate a fully atomistic, charged molecule \citep{Jorgensen1988}.

The increasing complexity in these systems was later very useful for determining the source of a discrepancy between engines.

\begin{table}

\end{table}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The forcefield parameters for TraPPE-UA and OPLS-AA are provided with Foyer \citep{foyer}. 
The non-bonded potential parameters for SPC/E water can be found in \autoref{tab:water}. 
The non-bonded potential parameters for the TraPPE-UA forcefield used for benzene can be found in \ref{tab:bz_nonbond}. No bonded potentials were used for either water or benzene as both molecules were modelled as a rigid bodies \citep{Nguyen2011a, Glaser2020a}. 


\begin{alignat}{3}
U_{LJ}(r) & = 4\epsilon\bigg[\bigg(\frac{\sigma}{r}\bigg)^{12} - \bigg(\frac{\sigma}{r}\bigg)^{6}\bigg]; && r<r_{cut} 
    \label{lj} \\
& = 0; && r>=r_{cut}
    \nonumber
\end{alignat}

see Equation~\eqref{lj}, \eqref{lrc_p}, \eqref{lrc_e}

In order to correct for the contributions of interactions beyond the cutoff, isotropic integrated long range tail corrections were applied to the Lennard-Jones pair potentials. The pressure and energy corrections $\Delta P$ and $\Delta E$ are given by
\begin{equation}\label{lrc_p}
    \Delta P = \frac{-2\pi}{3} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i \sum_{j=1}^{n} \rho_j
    \int_{r_\mathrm{cut}}^{\infty} \left( r
    \frac{\mathrm{d}V_{ij}(r)}{\mathrm{d}r} \right) r^2 \,\,\mathrm{d}r  
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{lrc_e}
    \Delta E = 2\pi \sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i \sum_{j=1}^{n} \rho_j
    \int_{r_\mathrm{cut}}^{\infty} V_{ij}(r) r^2\,\,\mathrm{d}r, 
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of unique particle types in the system, $\rho_{i}$ is the number density of particles of type $i$ in the system, $V_{ij}(r)$ is the pair potential between particles of type $i$ and $j$, and $N_{i}$ is the number of particles of type $i$ in the system. These expressions assume that the radial pair distribution functions, $g_{ij}(r)$, are unity at the cutoff and beyond.

%HOOMD handles the 1-4 scaling of non-bonded potentials using a separate force object, so the long range tail correction implemented in the Lennard-Jones potential is not applied to the LJ potential with 1-4 scaling. 
%This can explain the discrepancy in density seen in ethanolAA, the only model with scaled 1-4 interactions. 
%(PentaneUA would also have these interactions, but the 1-4 scaling is 0.)


Single point energy comparisons
Single point energy calculations were added to this studies when discrepancies were found in the simulation results. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that starting with a single point energy comparison would've been much more efficient--allowing discovery of many issues early in the study. It may be a good rule of thumb for simulators to provide a snapshot along with its energy breakdown when publishing. It is useful for folks who want to repeat your work!
In order to determine the causes of discrepancies in the energies reported between engines, a single point energy evaluation was done for all systems. This involved distributing the complete information for the starting system: atom coordinates and bonding and box information. This starting system was then initialized following the same procedure as the NPT/NVT ensemble simulations, but the simulation was not allowed to progress in time allowing direct comparison of the energies between engines.
Long range and short range electrostatic energies may not be comparable between engines due to differences in the way these terms may be partitioned; however, the total electrostatic energy is comparable.
Through comparison of the single point energies we discovered that 1-4 interactions were not being handled correctly by some engines.
In HOOMD water is modelled as a rigid body. It was found that when the neighborlist passed to \lstinline{make_pppm_coulomb_forces} excluded particles by body and bond and 1-3 (angle), the exclusions were double counted, resulting in a large discrepancy in the electrostatic energy. This is now noted in HOOMD's documentation.

Benefits:
This study provides comprehensive information: the results obtained and the exact code ran to obtain them. These data can be used by other simulators to validate their work.

HOOMD v3 is still in beta, so hoomd part of this project can serve as a valuable example of (1) how to run atomistic simulations consistently with other engines. (2) how to initialize rigid bodies using the MoSDeF framework--this is also the only available example of how to initialize rigid bodies on an existing system. HOOMD has some idiosyncrasies with its handling of rigid bodies: body particles must be first in the snapshot and the bodies must all have the same orientation on initialization. To reduce the cognitive load for users, HOOMD recommends creating the body constituent particles using the create\_bodies function, but this conflicts with using the MoSDeF initialization. (3) rigid bonds, (4) how to log individual energies such that they can be compared to other engines. (5) a full Shrink->NPT->(shrink)->NVT workflow with automated equilibration detection using pymbar.

    \caption{Workflow for HOOMD simulations in the reproducibility study.}\label{fig:rep_workflow}
\end{figure}
The workflow for the HOOMD simulations in shown in \autoref{fig:rep_workflow}. First the statepoint must be defined---this is handled by Signac \cite{Adorf2018, signac_zenodo, signac_scipy_2018, signac_scipy_2021}. The Signac project initialization script assigns all statepoint parameters (molecule, engine, replica, temperature, pressure, ensemble, N, box length, target density, mass, forcefield, cutoff style, long range correction, and $r_{cut}$) to each job. Then using that statepoint data, the system is initialized. To ensure that all engines are starting with the same system, this process is generalized: All engines use the \lstinline{construct_system}, which wraps mBuild's \lstinline{fill_box} to creates an mBuild \lstinline{Compound} object containing the simulation box at the specified density populated with the specified number of molecules, and \lstinline{load_ff}, which loads the correct foyer \lstinline{Forcefield} object from the forcefield name in the statepoint. Then the forcefield is applied to the system box compound to generate a ParmEd structure\cite{Shirts2017}, where the atoms are typed according to the forcefield and and the relevant force parameters are also stored within the structure object. From there each engine takes the parameterized ParmEd structure and converts it to the necessary input format. For HOOMD this is done using the \lstinline{create_hoomd_forcefield} function in mBuild, which handles the unit scaling, initial snapshot creation, and neighborlist and force creation using the information stored in the ParmEd structure. 
The nonbonded interactions were modelled as Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions. 
And charged interactions are computed via the particle particle particle mesh (PPPM) method as described in \citet{Darden1993} and \citet{Lebard2012}. A resolution of 64x64x64 and an order of 7 was used.
The bonded interactions were modelled as harmonic bonds, harmonic angles, and OPLS style dihedrals.
Some adjustments are made to the snapshot and forcefield after this to handle rigid bodies, constrained bonds, neighborlist exclusions, and long range correction. The the simulation is initialized, the integrators, methods, and logging are set and the simulation can be run. The first run step in this process is to run a brief shrink step to bring the system to the desired density. The shrink step starts with the volume expanded by 8 times (each length of the target box is 2 times larger) then the box is shrunk in the NVT ensemble over 100 ps with a thermostat coupling value of 1 ps at the simulation temperature. The NPT run is initialized from the final frame of the shrink trajectory and is run at high thermostat (1 ps) and barostat (5 ps) coupling values initially (for the first 1 ns) to prevent large fluctuations in the pressure and kinetic temperature and then they are lowered (0.1 ps and 1 ps) for the duration of the run. (Initial tau=1000dt tauS=5000dt for 1e6 steps then tauS=1000dt tau=100dt for 5e6 steps.) The NPT ensemble is run for a minimum of 6 ns, but after each NPT run, pymbar's \lstinline{detectEquilibration} function is used to check if the volume has equilibrated \cite{Chodera2007, Chodera2016, Shirts2008a}. If it has not, then the NPT simulation continues at the lower thermostat and barostat coupling values for an additional 5 ns. If the volume has equilibrated, then the statistically independent samples of the equilibrated volume are averaged and this average is logged to the job document and the job moves to the NVT run. The NVT run is initialized from the final frame of the NPT trajectory, but because this final frame may not be at the average volume a short (20 ps) shrink period is done for the initial NVT run and then the simulation is run for 5 ns. After the NVT run the same equilibration detection is used---this time looking at the potential energy values. If the potential energy is equilibrated the NVT run is finished, otherwise it is run again for an additional 5 ns from the last frame of the proceeding NVT run. Finally the log file written out by HOOMD is processed to remove any extra headers within the data from restarted jobs, convert the pressure and temperature from simulation units into kPa and K, and to calculate and log the density values from the volumes.

\section{Methods}

%% describe the overall workflows for each type of simulation, including system sizes, initialization protocols, [perhaps focusing on just the jobs you're running], and equilibration time
The study is formatted as a Signac project, so all code---from system initialization to project analysis for all engines---is contained in a single repository.
mBuild to populate the simulation box, Foyer to apply the forcefield, and mBuild to create the simulation input.
These scripts are publicly available on github \citep{reproducibility}.
The resulting output from all simulation engines is then converted to a standard format and unit system so that analysis can be done across simulation engines.
This data is then uploaded to a shared Dropbox folder using Rclone and once finalized the complete data will be distributed using Zenodo.

mBuild's packing functions, including \lstinline{fill_box}, are wrappers for PACKMOL \citep{Martinez2003, Martinez2009}.
PACKMOL uses an intrinsic random number generation method which is compiler dependent. 
The result is that creates different systems based on what operating system we are on.
In general, simulators are interested in comparing a sampling of the equilibrium ensemble, which should not depend on the initial position.
However, this discrepancy is important to note if one is trying to compare single point energies.
It also is a good reason to distribute the input structure along with the code used to generate it.

My contribution to this project was the scripts to run the HOOMD simulations, RDF analysis, and documentation and organization. 
This project involved a great deal of collaboration and discussion.
Although the systems studied are very simple, we ran into many hurdles:
Keeping consistent units.
Sharing data.
and many unexpected hurdles to get consistency between engines due to the different available functions in each engine. % wording?

Significant differences in the total energy and density were observed depending on how the non-bonded potential was handled beyond the cutoff value.
Let us define three cases: hard cutoff, shifted, and long-range correction (LRC). 
Hard-cutoff means that the potential is simply set to zero beyond $r_{cut}$ with no smoothing regardless of the potential’s value at $r_{cut}$, essentially a step function.
Shifted means the entire potential is shifted by the potential value at $r_{cut}$ (a constant) such that the potential at $r_{cut}$ is zero.
Finally, long-range correction means that a correction to the total energy and pressure is applied based on the particle number densities beyond $r_{cut}$ 

If a hard cutoff was used, the density did not agree between the MD and MC methods.
Some MC engines use impulsive contribution to the pressure which is not accounted for in MD and this may have some effect \citep{frenkel2001understanding}.
However GOMC does not have impulsive correction but has agreement with MC3S. Why do we see consistency between MD? and MC?
This is due to innate differences in the two methods: MD is using the interparticle forces---the derivative of the potential w.r.t. r---while MC uses the potential values outright.
Due to the discontinuity in the potential with hard cutoff, the force will be infinite in MD.

When using the shifted cutoff we may see similar discrepancies between the two methods. 
The potential is no longer discontinuous, but has an inflection point at $r_{cut}$ so the force will be discontinuous but not infinite.
Shifted cutoff is also not ideal for the force-fields we are using as they were all parameterized with LRC. 

So in order to achieve agreement between methods, we needed to use LRC to energy and pressure. 
By using the energy-pressure correction, we were able to get agreement between the energies and densities of both methods. 
Slight differences in the pressures were noted depending on if the ideal gas approximation is used for the pressure calculation.
Pressure is not matching between engines for the single snapshot of methane. 
The difference is due to the ideal gas contribution to pressure. 
Some engines are calculating the pressure at 0K and others at the specified temperature.

In order to test this in HOOMD I needed to write my own tail correction code referencing the formulas in Frenkel and Smit  \citep{frenkel2001understanding} and from eq 5 of  \citep{Sun1998}. 
This code can be seen at % cite my PR?

I also contributed to the code which calculates rigid bodies in HOOMD v3 % cite my PR?

This project was started in July 2021. 
This has been an opportunity to showcase some of the developments in HOOMD v3, which is still in beta. 
A number of changes and fixes have been initiated by this study, including the following which I am responsible for:
A bug was found in the way Ryckaert-Belleman (RB) dihedrals were converted to OPLS-style dihedrals (mbuild PR 996)
A change in the HOOMD neighborlist API adding the buffer as a required argument prompted a change in the mbuild \lstinline{create_hoomd_forcefield} function. (mbuild PR 988)
Some engines require more precision in the coordinate written to xyz files, so in order to use mbuild's xyz writing capabilities a precision keyword argument was added. (mbuild PR 948)

Choosing a timestep

For the ethanol system a smaller timestep was required.
When a timestep which was too large but small enough that the system didn't explode (i.e., the velocity update didn't push the particle outside of the simulation box) was used, the kinetic temperature was found to equilibrate to a lower value than was set in the NVT/NPT thermostat.
Unlike the other systems studied, ethanol has explicit hydrogens with harmonic bonds (water also has explicit hydrogens but it is rigid). 
Because hydrogen is such a light particle, the oscillations of bonds involving hydrogen are very fast.
The period of the harmonic bond is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:harmonic_period}
    T = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}}
\end{equation}
where k is the potential constant for that bond given in the forcefield and m is the mass of the particle.
Initially I was using a timestep of 0.001 (in simulation time units) while the period of the harmonic bond (see \autoref{eq:harmonic_period}) was 0.0118 (in simulation time units). \autoref{fig:harmonic_bond} shows the sensitivity of the harmonic bond sampling for different timesteps.

\end{figure}
By using a smaller timestep (0.0005), the temperature equilibrated to the correct value.

\end{figure}
\autoref{fig:temp_evo_ethanol} and \autoref{fig:temp_evo_methane} show the sensitivity of the equilibrium temperature to timestep based on system complexity. Both plots are very noisy because they show only the initial 100 ps post-shrink equilibration in the NVT ensemble, however the methane temperature fluctuates around the set value and these fluctuations are small (only a couple of degrees K) and smooth. While the ethanol fluctuations are much larger, and with the larger timestep, the fluctuations are not about the set equilibrium temperature.

\section{Conclusions}
Beyond just an opportunity to validate that our results were "right," working on this project together with other simulators with different backgrounds and expertise was an invaluable opportunity to learn.
