\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

As scientists we can't guarantee that our results are correct, but we can guarantee that they are reproducible.

My hope is that I have shown what reproducibility can look like in molecular simulation in particular and in computational sciences in general.
As someone who came into my PhD with almost no coding experience, I know the struggles of trying to reproduce someone else's work---especially scientific scripts which may be done to achieve a purpose without really considering the next user. 

Being able to be part of a broader collaboration where I was encouraged to build on and change some of the existing framework helped me to learn how to make my own projects.
Sharing and discussion of these works have helped me to see them from a different perspective and find where things were not clear.
